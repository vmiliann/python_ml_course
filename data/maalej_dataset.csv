1868,eu.chainfire.dslrcontroller,0.96.0,4,1365120633996,?,Shane Harder,almost perfect! but still amazing!!!!! this one app was the reason i got an android tablet over the ipad. a regular field monitor costs about the same if not much much more than a tablet. and that's for a standard 7 inch screen that's often times sub hd  with the nexus 10 (what i'm using) you have a 10 inch 2k screen with longer battery life and full camera control. it's almost crazy more people don't use this!!!  here's the one catch  the lag. it does lag a bit which makes run and gun shooting tough to say the least. i don't really do that kind of shooting as i usually will set up shots for scripted and partially scripted shoots. so for me it's really great.  if you absolutely need a filed monitor for run and gun/ fast moving subjects  it will be a better option. if you use one occasionally during interviews or other non fast moving situations  this is an incredibly amazing option. if they figure out the lag issue before the first official release then there is no reason not to get this instead of a dedicated monitor for the control features  screen size  price  screen resolution.  this developer is brilliant!!!!,OTHER
