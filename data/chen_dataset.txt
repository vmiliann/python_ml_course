lensix,ratingone,"can't turn off location tracking...
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"so sick and tired of getting network error messages when at the same time, facebook web works fine!
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"i always have to close the app from my multi-tasking so that the next time i open it, it will hopefully load my newsfeed.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"pictures and new stories load pretty slowly.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"my biggest pet peeve is that i can't ""like""
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"things 95% of the time, or it takes five or six taps to register the ""like.""
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"notifications frequently take me to something irrelevant.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"this is constantly having problems loading comments.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"i can almost never get them to show on pictures, status updates or anything else.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"has anyone else been having issues with constant force close?
",info
lensix,ratingone,"can't post since last update.
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"also, they need to make it so that you can hide posts from certain people like the website does.
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"the app is good & all, but some images in my news feed can only be previewed instead of opened.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingtwo,"occasionally, the app says that the image can't be opened & please try again later.
",info
lenfour,ratingone,"move to sd please
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"news feed shows no pics...
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"the only thing about the newer app i hate is the ""like"" and ""comment"" feature is broken.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"i have installed and  uninstalled this several time to get an up to date time line....
",info
lenten,ratingone,"slow, rarely loads anything - pages, photos, comments - nothing, constantly crashes.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingone,"i can't change my covert photo from my phone,  searching for anything is awful, i have to type , then delete, then retype, then it works.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"loading pics and comments take much longer, i.don't like it.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"serious bug dealing with notifications.
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"opening app from a notification after its been running in the background for a while results in endless wait loop.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"never shuts down in the background and has no exit button.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"reinstalled to get the share link back bit the churning following a notification is still awful.
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"still has issues with check-ins. :|
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"after the latest update, i have not been able to post status updates on the first try, even with strong 4g data or wifi.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"generally speaking, the app seems much slower than previous versions.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"i see ""unable to establish a secure connection"" errors often.
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingthree,"also it refreshes while i'm trying to read updates in my news feed and seems me to top of news feed page so i have to scroll and search for what i was reading.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"facebook crashes at least three times a day on my galaxy s2.

leneight,ratingone,"i constantly clear data, but it still crashes...
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingthree,"cant post photos to certain albums, cant delete comments & sometimes when i try uploading photos, they say 'error and photo cannot be uploaded' or somethin :/

",info
lensix,ratingthree,"scrolling lag from time to time.
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"slow loading after last update...
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"rarely refreshes news feed on the first try.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"only shows up to 98 likes on a photo
",info
lennine,ratingtwo,"i wish we could save pics from this app
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"does everything you would expect, still needs some work on the approvals for privacy confirmation process.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingtwo,"but the major issue i have is some background task is grinding my phone to a halt.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"i cant delete comments anymore ever since i updated it ..
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"pointless to even have on my phone anymore can't even use it like i should be able to..

",info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"after updating my system shuts down, i get errors and i can't post anything.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"will not refresh at all on my droid
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"far too slow never loads , cant see anything , 'crap' any time i refresh it goes straight onto my actual internet !!!
",info
lensix,ratingone,"keeps crashing, forcing it to close.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"also you carnt view pictures
",info
lensixty,ratingone,"yeah so this app ain't bad i use it more than the browser but that's gonna change, i was wondering why my phone memory was all gone so i decided to uninstall the updates now i got a load more memory, so until you can save this app to the memory card then i'm not using it.
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"won't even let me log in!
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingtwo,"for some reason i cannot update my facebook status, leave comments, like things or perform any action on the mobile device that actually works.
",info
lensix,ratingone,"keeps losing conection, therefore uninstalling updates
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"on my nexus seven tablet, nothing loads.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"i simply get a network error message.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"dear facebook,  please stop prompting me to add friends every friggin time i open your app.
",info
lenthirtyseven,ratingfive,"it worked perfectly fine for me until yesturday when i was on my laptop and changed my password, it logged me off my phone so i logged in with the new password and it kept saying error.
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"can't remove comments anymore.

lennine,ratingtwo,"been having issues with newsfeed refresh prior to that.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingone,"now it tells me i have a single sign-on error, which even the great google search has not given me any clues on how to fix.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"it will sign in, but won't sync anything and won't post anything so it's basically useless for my purposes.
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"so u have to ask me if i want to use my contacts to find friends multiple times a day.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"can't type two words without the thing crashing...
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"the only complaint i have is that it has problems loading pics.
",info

",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"also: there's no way to upload a photo directly to one person's wall.
",info
lenthirty,ratingfour,"another neat option, if the developer wanted to make this really awesome, is an option to pre-cache recent posts by friends and in groups, for offline (aka subway) viewing.

",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"ever since it upgraded, it shuts down and locks me out with a black screen for a good 10 mins.

",non-info
lensix,ratingtwo,"getting very aggravated after latest update.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"iphone app is beastin this out the box!!
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"since the updates, facebook for android has become, in my opinion, a much better app.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"it's easy to use, and you can now effectively see an 'offline news feed'!
",non-info
lenthirtyseven,ratingfive,"with simple-to-use features such as a 'pull down and release' mechanism to refresh the page, a swipe-out chat bar on the right and a swipe-out menu on the left, user friendliness is great!

",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"feel great to have it!

",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"This is an awesome app.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfour,"no longer i need to use the regular Internet;)
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"I think there may be a bug or glitch in the last update.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"The app basically keeps you connected and updated about your family and friends via Facebook.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfour,"You can do watever you like..

lenseven,ratingfour,"I gave u a bad review previously...
",non-info

",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"Why change what was working fine?
",non-info
lensix,ratingfour,"Good App Until It's Updated !

lentwelve,ratingtwo,"This is the fourth time I install this app after long time.

",non-info
lenfour,ratingone,"Liked it better before

leneighteen,ratingone,"I am a regular fb user bt this version makes me think should I use fb this poorly?
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"Seems like every update is worse and worse.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"I wish they would juat fix this app right and then quit messing with it.
",non-info
lenten,ratingone,"Total junk, Facebook is worthless, updates don't do anything.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"Why don't you actually fix something that will actually make Facebook work.

",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingone,"I've had this app for a year now and after all the negative comments and feedback, they still can't get it right.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfour,"Nice Improvement
",non-info

",non-info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"Latest updates are a huge improvement on my phone, FB must have finally gotten some decent android devs!

lentwelve,ratingone,"F.b. Seems to dictate want it wants now moving to Google
",non-info
lenfive,ratingone,"Therefore this facebook is horrible
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingone,"I've tried uninstalling this app and reinstalling it with no luck.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"I don't know who you hired but I could serially develop a better app.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingtwo,"Lay outs good....
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingtwo,"Why is it this app gets worse and worse everytime its updated.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingone,"Worst update yet.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingone,"Such a stuped error in programing facebook !!!!
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"This is the fastest version of facebook u will ever see till date.
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"The new update has certainly made a lot changes including the new view of comments and also a very quick interface.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingone,"seems like developer problem.
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"I've uninstalled and re installed.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"I have seen monkeys throwing crap at the zoo do a better job!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingtwo,"All other apps work fine and I need to close the FB app in the taskbar and reopen.

",non-info
lentwo,ratingfour,"Goood app
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfour,"I Love FaceBook<3
",non-info
lennine,ratingone,"The ios app is 100% better this piece of crap....
",non-info
leneleven,ratingone,"Do you pay your testers in bananas and a back scratch?
",non-info
lenfive,ratingone,"Totally a first world problem...
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"But please address these issues, as I'm clearly NOT the only one with them
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"Pretty tired of dealing with it.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfour,"I like to use it a lot.
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"Seriously am frustrated with this update !
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"FIX IT or I'm deleting my Facebook .
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingone,"Cuz my phone is the only way I can go on it !!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingone,"This app sucks!!!
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"It doesn't even work properly.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingthree,"To easy do the chat
",non-info
lenfive,ratingone,"I hate this new update!
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"Its almost 2013 and this app is still going backwards its really crippled by 90 %!!!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfour,"too far from pc version but good
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfour,"Upgrading to 4 stars.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingtwo,"Those are still planning to update, i reccommend that u shoudn't.
",non-info
lennine,ratingthree,"3 stars because this app is pretty good and fast.
",non-info
lensix,ratingthree,"Quite satisfied with last couple updates.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfour,"Facebook is da best
",non-info
lenfour,ratingone,"This update sucks man.
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"Make a functional app before anything.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingone,"Makes millions.
",non-info
lenten,ratingone,"Fix it soon Many android's has the same prblm.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingone,"Hate this new Facebook.
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingtwo,"Plz bring it back in the app this new thing is piece of shit it was not fast before but atleast it was functional
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"For a social media giant you would expect something that at least works.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingthree,"Much better than old versions.
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"This is the worst update yet!!!
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"Instead of constant updates, how about making an app that actually works, on all platforms!
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"This update is a total waste of space.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingone,"Blows my mind!
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"No wonder this app has 1 million 1-star ratings.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"Once worked great now sucks.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfour,"And I want swift key to save the words I type.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"I think it could do with a bit more customization...
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"And a few more settings for example, after I insert specific types of punctuation it sometimes put a space after..It would be good to be able to turn that off.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfive,"Also another good one is being able to make the space bar bigger by removing the smiley key on the bottom right making the keyboard bigger.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"I really would like to see Chinese language integration to be developed.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"Very annoying to switch with other input methods.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"Does not work with S-Pen on Galaxy Note 2
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"I love the keyboards and what not it looks so awesome but just need some more themes to choose from or more customization choices.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Last time it was smileys/predictions without spaces messing up other languages than english.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"Used to work perfect but after i had accidentally deleted it, can't get it to work again after reinstall.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"It WAS awesome until the layout was changed.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"It may work for large displays but NOT phones with cases on them!
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"I hate the new slide punctuation bar!
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"Bring smaller space bar back!
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingone,"You need to add something to allow us to edit the prediction word database. This way, we can manually erase unwanted crap, periods & commas!!!
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingthree,"When your in messages and lock the screen, once you turn it back on the suggestions are gone and you have to close and re open SwiftKey.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"Everytime I turn my phone off or restart it it goes back to default keyboard and I have to keep activating this one...
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"Great app but without emoji support its only sub par
",info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"Im not fond of the fact, i have to constantly switch to go keyboard for Chinese either,  over rated.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"Wish I could customize the layout, then I would give 5 stars.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"Awesome keyboard just lags with Google takes forever to show up.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"I like how you did pumpkin for Halloween can we get a Christmas theme.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"Because of missing of Macedonian language!
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"Ever since the jellybean update,  you have to exit the messaging application and open it up again for word prediction to work..
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"I also don't like that you can't use swear words.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"I'm 23, please let me use what words I want to use.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"I am tired of this fueling keyboard refusing to use swear words.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"Swiftkey's has limited 3 words predicted for selection.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"I find it terribly annoying that now the prediction bar, and corrections don't work 50% of the time.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"I have to close the keyboard and then reopen for this to work.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"Also, I should be able to delete typos that have been presumed predictions.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"It is missing one thing, however. Emoji support.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"If this language/font were to be added, SwiftKey would win the award for best Android app.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"After having the language constantly failing to download, and now not downloading at all.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"But very glitchy on Google chrome, keeps typing previous word when pressing the backspace key...
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"Only problem i have is the exclamation mark.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"Very very poor set up,  it almost never works when you swipe the multi button.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"Always puts a period or a comma, never an exclamation mark.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"Until I updated to Jelly Bean, I would give this app 5 stars.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"However, following the update on my S3 to Jelly Bean, it now reverts to the Samsung keyboard as the default every time I restart the phone.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingone,"From my understanding, it is an issue the developers are aware of and have stated that we all need to wait until Jelly Bean is updated to 4.1.2.
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"I just need Chinese!!!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"Otherwise it's such a pain to switch keyboards just to type one Chinese character!
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"Keeps rebooting vzw gnex and numerous bug reports and posts left unanswered or even unacknowledged using pay version too...
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"Just wish there were more themes to choose from and that of your backspace from an auto completed word that it would defer to what you originally typed.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"As stated before SwiftKey does not load after a reboot. It has to be disabled an re enable again.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"Great keyboard and prediction but needs SWIPE function for portrait mode and better customization
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"Update: Using on the LG Optimus G and the cursor KEEPS  jumping to the top of the field in the middle of sentences.
",info

",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"Uninstalled until I can save it to the SD card, everything is great except for the amount of space it takes up.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"This app is very good, but it can run a little laggy on my GS3
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"Give me a red version of the ""holo"" theme and you'll get 5 stars.
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"The only thing I do hate is when I enter a full stop then  space it automatically In puts (I) so my sentences start with I when I'm typing fast.
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"Used to be the best keyboard ever since jellybean update now on my GS3 it will not hold as default :'-(
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"I would love to more themes, the current themes are great but I love customising my phone.
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"Wheres the clipboard button?
",info
lensix,ratingone,"This auto correct is illogical sometimes.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"When I type ""just""  I don't mean ""justified"".
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"It will also auto capitalize words that don't need to be capitalized.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"Was excellent but pasting has recently broken on my Samsung galaxy s3 which is very frustrating!!
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingtwo,"I don't know what sort of processor is expected for running a keyboard but swift key can't keep up with my typing for the most part on a Samsung galaxy tablet 10.1
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfour,"Only suggestions I have would be a tab key for use with Web browsers and such and a personal dictionary would be nice to help speed the keyboards learning process up
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"Please add a few themes frequently.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"I love this keyboard,  but I notice a significant decrease in my battery life when I use it.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"It would be perfect if there was a delete key!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"I would give it 5 stars if predictive text was supported in all apps.
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"As it stands, too many apps remain unsupported.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Love it but needs emoji support now
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingtwo,"Pretty good,  I get sick of checking everything to make sure it's predicting what I actually wanted, it seems to lag a lot too
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"Just wish it had more themes.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"One like Holo but red in place of the blue would rock.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"Only thing is it couldn't input Chinese language.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingfive,"I love this app best $3 I've ever spent drastically increases texting speed if you have it set up right could use some more themes like a black background with neon green letters
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"The one and only problem I have is this program needs to do a better with choosing which punctuation sentences should receive.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"I would like it if there were emoticon add ons for this keyboard like there are some of the other ones though...
",info
lentwentysix,ratingthree,"This app is okay except that the keys are loud when I type, so if I'm working or hunting I have to change the settings.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"And if I'm just not finding how to change the setting I apologize but I've looked everywhere on the phone
",info
lenthree,ratingfour,"Needs more themes!
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"Love the "".com""  button but I wish it were in a different place. Maybe put it on the left side of the space bar.
",info
lenfour,ratingtwo,"You need more themes..
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"It's a great keyboard,  I just get board with the limited options
",info
leneight,ratingone,"It's useless application with Jelly Bean keyboard.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"In the Dvorak layout, the lowercase 'M' & 'W' keys are supposed to display '(' & ')' on long press. The 'W' usually displays a '0' instead, but occasionally readjusts.
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingone,"This would have been a 4 star but the inability to hide the ""com"" button while in a browser renders it nearly useless. Hit it all the time when trying to hit the space bar.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"I'll lower my rating to 4 stars since the Jelly Bean bug resetting the keyboard to stock at each reboot has been around for long without being fixed.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"I the only reason I give it a 4 is because there is no swipe texting.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"Would you be able to make an update with Vietnamese language though?
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"Just hope they continue to make it more battery efficient...
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"1 - The keyboard reverts to the original Android Keyboard every time the USB storage becomes disconnected.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingthree,"Every time I hook up to the computer or shut down the phone and restart, I have to re-enable it via the Android OS Settings.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"Great in most circumstances, but when sending odometer readings via text for tracking purposes, there's no reason for it to track it.
",info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"Numbers, for the most part, could probably be ignored or at least give us the option to ignore them.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"I don't need it suggesting an odometer reading I'll never see again.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"It would also be nice to be able to edit the remembered words and add or remove words, especially in multiples.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"But could you guys add a swiping option?
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"If I take the time to manually capitalize letters and add apostrophes, etc, then swiftkey shouldn't try to change it.
",info
lensix,ratingone,"Needs improvement in Arabic language support
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"My only wish is the ability to add words to dictionary & more keyboard options with symbols like hearts that come standard on most Samsung galaxy s3
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"The only weird thing I encountered was on my RAZR while it's charging the keyboard acts very weird.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Amazing app, although I wish there were more themes to choose from.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"It doesn't allow you to use the prediction features on text fields that already have it.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"An example is when you type something on Google search app, you're abandoned to the slow typing process again.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"The same happens in some contact names fields such as Gmail, GOSMS Pro, Any.do. Etc.
",info
lenfortyfour,ratingtwo,"I was not happy with the keyboard after coming from iPhone to Android until i tried Swiftkey, HOWEVER, i have  found quite a few apps that refuse to show the predictive text...like the built in browser on my Galaxy S3 and way more Update;
",info
lentwentyone,ratingtwo,"giving up until they fix predictive text and make keyboard thy doesn't have all th keys basically touching each other.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"whenever i wanna use the sign () it always write wrong and impossible to use.
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingone,"i have tried to ask if possible to add ""numbers"" on top of the keyboard like on Samsung original keyboard and they sent me to write on their blog... but no one answer, nobody care...
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"I'm using the trial keyboard, but can't miss the sale off :), buy it and waiting for Vietnamese language...
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"I would really like to see more customization like more keyboard clolors and maybe some emoj that's different from iPhone.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"This keyboard is good but it really needs more theme.
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"Just at least one of all the major colors. ESPECIALLY RED!
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"Please made available for moving app to rom for faster keyboard entries
",info
lentwentynine,ratingone,"It always adds spaces after full stops, and adds unwanted words after commas, I wish I hadn't paid for this before I knew there was a free version
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"Have turned off as does not support pen entered text on Samsung note 2.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"Have turned off as note ii does not work properly.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingtwo,"If you are not going to fix it then make it assignable to applications so it can be ignored for apps where it doesn't work.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"I want more color fonts
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"Why is there no Tab key?
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingthree,"But when I have to put numbers into a password or messaging someone and using numbers the numbers come out jumbled, please look into this, sent from my gs3
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingtwo,"I use it on my Samsung Galaxy S3 on Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean. The only complaint I do have are a couple of bugs.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingtwo,"On occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"I am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to Facebook.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"It renders it useless anytime I see something Facebook worthy.
",info
lenfour,ratingone,"Fatal support for Polish.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"I really dislike how it fails to show predictions during Web browser use.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"There are so many things you can tweak as well such as prediction invoking and theme.
",info
lenthirty,ratingfour,"Totally annoying when I'm used to typing as best I can and picking predictions from the list. At least please give us the option to turn it on / off.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"The only issue with it is that about 35% of the time the prediction bar does not show up/auto correct does not work.
",info
lennine,ratingtwo,"Great app but becomes sluggish every now and then.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"However, give me the option to disable the auto space after punctuation and ill give it five stars.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingtwo,"It's not a bad keyboard replacement but it insists on putting a space after periods, making it a real pain to type URLs into text messages.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"The only thing I really dislike is the space it adds after punctuation.
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfour,"I'm used to typing correctly in the first place so I add the space myself and SwiftKey adds one as well as you can see in this review with all the double spaces.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"I want to turn predictions completely OFF, but can't?
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"5 stars if could turn off predictions.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"I'd love to see the option to enable a dedicated number row though, for those of us with those huge phones.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"Just add emojis and more themes.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"Would give 5 stars if a personal dictionary is added as well as the option to learn from whatsapp.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Would like S Pen support for Galaxy Note 2 so I don't have to swap when writing documents.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"But the predictions bar doesn't appear for for the Samsung at all..
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"And when I'm typing rapidly and trying to press the space button.. It hits the. com
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"Whenever I try to enter a search term this app seems to stop working all together... Why is that?
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Wish for more keyboard themes to come.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfive,"Love this keyboard and just got the update to JB on my EVOLTE and was wondering if you guys were implementing Emoji support for the keyboard?
",info
lentwo,ratingthree,"Emoji support.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"Why doesn't any keyboard have emoticons?
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfour,"This keyboard is amazing but the only problem I have with it is that when I use Google drive it slows down and lags SO much.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I just wish they would add swipe
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"Would like to see a couple more themes, but I have no complaints as the Holo theme is gorgeous.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"I think it provides a great writing experience, but it slows down my overall smartphone readiness and needs an huge amount of ram..
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"A ridiculous amount of RAM!
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"Please provide swipe support like the latest keyboard update provided by Google for nexus.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"When ever I enter my email address the auto space messes shot up.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"Lack of hand writing support for the Note 2 is a shame, will inable again when this is supported.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"Loved Swiftkey3 on my evo hate it on the note
",info
lennine,ratingtwo,"A lot of bugs in connection with hardware keyboards!
",info
lennine,ratingtwo,"The app also has trouble downloading the language packs ...
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingone,"Now, occasionally the text predictions won't come up AT ALL and it seems like words are being put in that I NEVER was attempting to write.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"Also, I am not too fond of the fact that when I do spell a word wrong, it doesn't automatically insert the correct word.
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"Love the word suggestions but keyboard locks up constantly on my S3
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"But can we have more themes for the keyboard =)
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"Edit: The keyboard stop predicting when I am in Any.do, Facebook web browser and several other applications that I couldn't remember.
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingthree,"Though India is a big client of all mobile handsets and apps, everybody is neglecting Indian customers and their needs,I am hopefully waiting for Hindi,Marathi and other Indian languages upgrade packs from swiftkey ASAP.
",info
lenforty,ratingthree,"However,  every time I close all apps and ram memory and I go on any sort of message board,  texting or any type of typing it doesn't automatically pop up with SwiftKey and it shows the regular crappy keyboard.
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"Long story short I have to go change the options to have SwiftKey on every time I want to text.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"Suggestion for the developer: make that when the hardware is changed you don't loose all that the app has learned.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"I wish there were more personalization options with colors, to match the theme For your phone.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"Won't start automatically on GS3 however.
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"But it is not compatible with 4.1.1  So frustrated.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"Split keyboard does NOT work on the Note in spite of thousands of users flagging it inside reviews.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"I hope that swiftKeys will implement chinese typing too.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"The keyboard gets laggy sometimes and makes apps lag on jelly bean.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"Most notably Google now.... it's very slow whilst using swiftkey.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"I wish there will be more themes added
",info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Please integrate swype.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"Anyway I couldn't thank SwiftKey any better for such an amazing keyboard, just wish that they will come out with better features and personalization along with new themes!
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"Prediction does not work anymore.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"I only wish they had more color scheme.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"With a recent update to Jellybean, SwiftKey no longer automatically uses predictions when texting.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"I have to back out of every message and go back in before it will start fixing typos or using predictive text.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"I was very disappointed that when installing the paid version it did NOT import.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingthree,"The settings from the trial version and now i am left having to battle the same initial problems when i first inatalled the trial.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"Very disappointing that such an intuitive app is so non-intuitive in the upgrade process
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"Since I updated my S3 to Kelly Bean sometimes SwiftKey is not even activating when I go to text or type.
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingone,"I have to exit whatever I'm doing or send a text or 2 before it will start working, but as I said it's very inconsistent, was never an issue while using with ICS.
",info
lenfiftyone,ratingfour,"I love this keyboard hands down the best one on the market only issue is for some reason when I I'm typing fast the keyboard always seems to static like a tv with no service I thought it was my phone but now I have the note 2 n same thing..
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfour,"I just hate how when I click the 123 icon on the keyboard I hate how the layout looks,  im use to the regular S3 keyboard 123456789 on the top
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"5 stars either way but an Emoji add on would be awesome.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"I don't like the way that it handles using different languages.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"I wish there was a way to toggle between languages instead of having them integrated into one keyboard.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"Would have given this 5 stars if it worked well with king soft office.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"Drawback, could do with more skins.
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfour,"Great keyboard only issue I have is when my phone wakes into a text it doesn't use prediction so I have to back out and go back in for the prediction to work
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"Was working excellently on 4.0.3, but in 4.0.4, has some defects...
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"Feeling a small hick when keyboard comes on screen and sometimes it does not work...
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"Can't go without this keyboard anymore, though I'd still love to be able to disable gestures
",info
lenfive,ratingfive,"It does occasionally stop typing.
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"Kinda laggy when opening and closing..
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"Just recently app repeatedly force closes until it is disabled in input settings.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"The Arabic implementation is very good but needs some fine tuning
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"Can't remember my email address.
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"Has a problem remembering simple words.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"Please fix the cause for the keyboard not sticking as the default keyboard.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"I used this a long time ago, and picked it up for a buck during the sale, but it needs more customization options.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"Namely, the smiley key needs custom smileys.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"Pls update thai language i have been waiting for the long time
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingtwo,"Sometimes word prediction doesn't show up. Have to exit out of keyboard then get back on again for it to appear.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"really loving it ;)  wish it wouldnt eat so much ram tho 28mb of ram?!
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"I would like some more customization options, such as disabling the keypress letter highlight, custom skins (even if just hex colors from a file).
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I have no complaints, just a request that you keep adding new themes!
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"English, of course, but with Korea prediction and everything?
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"The beta edition for Thai has been expired. Could you add it to any Thai peoples?
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingfive,"My only flaw is since the jelly bean update if I have the keyboard open in messages and my screen locks; once the screen comes back the prediction function doesn't work
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"It works great for everything but not so good when add ing non common names.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"something is happening and it is causing me to have to download the language over and over again.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"But I would love a cleaner looking interface.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"Would love to have a option to hide all the extra long press keys minus the numbers.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingtwo,"Frankly some of the predictions are ridiculous you are better off with the normal keyboard.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"Not compatible with jelly bean.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"Resets after boot or restart.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"Will not set itself as default keyboard.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"I recommended it to all of my friends, but ever since ics this app has been HORRIBLE.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"The keyboard is horribly laggy.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"I've downloaded it more than 3 times and it keeps saying error
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"Only issue found till date is that it crashes often with chrome, but that is not a deal breaker for me.
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"Only complaint: no swype mode.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"Would be better if echo stopped cheating though
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Would be cool if we could have some emojis added on to it
",info
lennine,ratingone,"Due to error 941 this is bs. Cannot refund either
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"Wouldn't install on my gs3
",info
lenten,ratingone,"I just purchased this app but it says error downloading.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"It does not install. Error 941
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"I enjoy this app as it helps correct my errors fast but it doesn't remember the personal words I put in.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"And I'd like to see more, newer themes.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"The only thing that I can think of to make this app better would be more themes!
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"I just wish there was an option to hide the keyboard.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"Bigger space bar, more themes, faster responses, and more intuitive.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"Every time you reboot your device it reverts back to stock keyboard!
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"As mentioned by some others some times it seems to slow down on certain other apps while the original never did so.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfour,"I sure don't mind but at the same time making even speedier and smooth as jelly bean is on my s3 would always be greatly appreciate it.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"They updated recently with two new themes, but they're too girly. How about a few more?
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"It would be nice if it used the personal dictionary.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"Developers could add a slide type of writing and that would be awesome.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"I would give it a 5 if i support chinese as well.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingone,"But after a month of having it, it became extremely slow, typing on the screen would not happen, half the time corrections would not even show up.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"But since I root my phone, I constantly change roms, therefore reseting all my words.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"It feels bad reseting 2000 custom words.
",info
lenfiftynine,ratingthree,"I was hoping to have a good heart symbol with the key board because that's something a girl uses a lot for commenting on photos and stuff like that if added, and I would be much happier with the application and rate it a five stars but, there are not a lot of color choices for your keyboard......
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingfour,"The functional keys in the bottom: shift, enter, backspace etc. come in a certain color with every theme. I would like this color to be fully customisable to make it fit my phone's theme better.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"Best prediction keyboard available but mediocre design and button placement.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"Amazing keyboard and good value but it needs to have slide/swipe options.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingone,"Predictions and double space bar to accept predictions and insert period are not longer available in browsers and many other apps.
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"Spell check randomly stops working.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"Prediction will sometimes turn off when I sleep the phone.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"Need S-Pen button and writing grid for the galaxy note!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"Needs better emotes and I thinks that's it except maybe custom keyboards.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"If you could customize the keyboard to a different colour for all keyboards, I will give you 5 stars.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"The back-spacing on the keyboard is a bit slow. I wish I could adjust it.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingtwo,"This work great for a while but now keeps crashing my phone and my phone won't work again until I pull the battery
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"Just need to be sure that you check over what you're typing as it can get weird if you're not careful.
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"Just add swype pleeease
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"Only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is I can not use swype as on the Samsung keyboard.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"SK3 was working flawlessly until the AT&T JB update for S3 recently came out.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingtwo,"When locking the screen while having the text field open and the keyboard out and then unlocking the phone, the text field rewrites itself and resizes.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"Also, there is lag in the keyboard processes when sending and receiving messages.
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"Will return to give 5 stars once jb update issues are resolved.
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingthree,"I would like to see the numbers separately above the the first row of the keys. And when on land scape mode it takes up the whole screen and will not show you the text screen.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"I've had it for a whole but avoided using it because it doesn't matter have the heart symbol like the Samsung keyboard.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"(I still hope for some hearts :D)
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I do wish it supported Japanese characters, but otherwise it's perfect.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"Plzzzz i luv swiftkey but no vnmese support is a dealbreaker for me
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"Nice keyboard but even in its new v3 incarnation there's no dedicated voice key, hence losing a star.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"C'mon Swiftkey, YOU NEED A DEDICATED VOICE KEY!
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"It doesn't have a percent symbol, what the hell kind of keyboard doesn't have a percent symbol
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"Would be awesome if it didn't keep resetting back to its original settings every 5 mins.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"atm the lowest sound level for the type writer style sound is way too loud, I'd really like a quieter option!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"wish there was some more themes for it like maybe a pink one? :-)
",info
lentwentythree,ratingtwo,"Used to work brilliantly with previous android versions but the Swiftkey auto correct function stopped working after using it with Android jelly bean.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingthree,"As much as is pains me to say, this app has been the root of a bunch of problems on my phone. Crashes and freezing are all too familiar when this is active.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"But I wish it used less memory!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"The word ""it's"" is almost impossible and always comes out as ""is"".
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"Also could you allow use of could words?
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"Please integrate learning from WhatsApp Messenger as well.
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingfour,"At the bottom corner there's an option for the regular smileys while texting but can there be an option to switch those to emoji or even an option to change them to what you want?
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Sometimes wish it had more themes though.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"Only snag is the haptic feedback doesn't work.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"However the shift key could be either less sensitive or moved.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"Often times when I hit the ""A"" key I hit the shift key.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"I can't download the language pack. It's the same error over and over again.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"Good app but the Turkish dictionary is very insufficient. It doesn't contain many basic words.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"I request developers to add the support for training the keyboard through whatsapp similar to twitter, Google and Facebook.
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"Suggested words were never accurate either.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"It's good but I'm only going it 4 stars because it doesn't have swype.
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"The best,no s-pen detection?
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"where is handwriting for s pen?
",info
lensixtythree,ratingfive,"My only issue with this and it's a SERIOUS issue with me is that since I got the update for my S III to 4.1 is that I can not find out how to turn off the haptic feedback when I type. The phone's settings have it turned off but no matter what I do to try and troubleshoot it, nothing works.
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"would love more themes!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"But, it's been almost a year and I think one new theme was added!
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"Come on guys... Get on board the theme wagon!
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Would like to see manual selection between languages instead of auto detection.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"This by far the best keyboard out there, but with my recent update to JB, its kinda laggy and not so functional.
",info

",info
lenthirtynine,ratingthree,"Why is the smiley face button more important than the enter button? With a keyboard that's supposed to be fast and cater to the user it makes no sense as to why this shouldn't be an option.

",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"The keyboard sometimes have a lag when typing, especially on number pad.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"Other thing is that the layout is confusing when you need to quickly use symbol, I like my S3 stock keyboard layout more.
",info

",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfour,"My only slight annoyance is when the "".com"" key appears. I wish there was an option to hide it, I seem to press it on accident often.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"Also, why does SwiftKey continually give me a notification for choosing the default keyboard?
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"After upgrading to Jelly Bean, this app had stop working, language pack  download failed...

lentwo,ratingfive,"More themes..?
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"Works perfect but for some reason it lags when I exit the typing mode.

",info
leneight,ratingfour,"BUT PLEASE HAVE A SEPARATE KEY FOR ""!"" AND ""?""!!!
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingfive,"One thing it needs is the ability to change to the writing pad as I am using the galaxy note 2 and sometimes I prefer it that way, otherwise this is almost near perfect.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"The only thing I would add is more customisation options!
",info
lentwenty,ratingtwo,"This app is very good w/ English  But Arabic layout is very annoying, Please use Windows layout instead of MAC
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"But why does it take up 27 MB of RAM on my Galaxy Nexus?
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"The more RAM programs use the less program you can run EFFICIENTLY, slowing down the phone in general.
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingfour,"Often I notice slowdown on my phone and find app taking up RAM for no reason and have to uninstall the Hogs. This is similar to the memory leak problem Firefox has on the desktop.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"Could you add a new theme ""RED NEON"" just like the blue neon (which is great by the way)....
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"Arabic letters are rather small
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"but uses good amount of ram in background.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"It's a decent keyboard replacement but I feel that the famous prediction and correction engine is a little overhyped especially the auto correction part.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"For example typing lowercase free standing ""i"" isn't auto capitalized, typing ""whats"" isn't auto corrected to ""what's"" and so on.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"It also takes a lot of memory.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"Sometimes its a bit freaky how predictable this is.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"Just wish it had more themes.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"But frequently it does weird things when trying to type on the Web.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"(Dolphin) Frequently when entering text in a field it repeats the first key press instead of typing the letters I am pressing.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Best keyboard that u can find, thr personalization on it is just unpredictable!
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"It would be nice if it had some options to take advantage of the huge screens that are coming out.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"Good but please have a save to see card option I payed 4 bucks for this and I takes up a lot of space.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"But would like to see more colors please!
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"this is the best keyboard ever, but it eats quite a lot of ram
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"Jelly Bean resets Swiftkey when the phone is restarted.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"Any chance to add Chinese language?
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"Just wish you could swipe also
",info
lenfour,ratingone,"Main problem prediction (lithuanian).
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"Would be more stars if there was possibility to turn off the prediction.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"Now it seems to be making up its own words and not correct anything even when I have cleared the language data.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"It needs a number row like the stock note keyboard
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"When I use this keyboard on my gs3 it is very unresponsive and laggy.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"Only complaint is the amount of RAM needed and the delay that occurs when closing the keyboard after hitting the home button.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"I will support you if you add support for Japanese language.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"It kinda annoys me that it has persian (who in the world speaks persian) and not such a widely known language as Japanese.
",info
lenthree,ratingfive,"More themes please.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"Only request is for a collapse keyboard button. Sometimes buttons like that are just needed.
",info
lensix,ratingone,"Time for more themes thank u
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"Love it, all it needs is more themes.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"I'll give 5 stars when the Jellybean issue is fixed.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"I want to see performance increased for the Samsung Galaxy S3.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"All the app really lacks is more themes.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"Good keyboard but, can we disable the prediction?
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"Once the swype features are added it'll be unrivalled!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Just wish you had more themes or ability to make a custom theme.
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"I dont know what the dev thought when he decided to ask for email and facebook access (major security concern).
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"The app is supposed to allow y to delete mistaken words you don't want in the language model.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingtwo,"I press and hold the prediction, and there is no option to delete! It's really annoying because common typos then become predictions
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"After reboot im locked back into the Samsung keyboard, help me it is already set for default
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"But the only downside is that since jellybean update its constantly ""forget"" the default keyboard selection...
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"Overall product quality is very good except it's user defined library doesn't work with whatsapp.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"Because of whatsapp issue I can just give 3 stars...
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingfive,"My only concern is that when entering emails the app needs to recognize that you are doing so and needs to adjust accordingly (eithout automatically spacing after periods, auto capatilizing letters for certain email addresses).
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"But really bad performance on 4.1.
",info
lenseven,ratingtwo,"Hangs often and really slow button response.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"The only issue I have is that it is slow to start up at times in most apps.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"Please fix the slow start up times and this is a perfect keyboard!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"I love this keyboard but have started having an issue after upgrade to Jelly Bean.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"The Predictions row gets turned off each time I wake the screen if the keyboard was open when the screen goes to sleep.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"If I close the keyboard and reopen, predictions come back.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Let's get some more themes now! ;-)
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"but now that i use voice input, there is no easy way of inserting a full stop.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfour,"add a feature so that while talking to the mobile, there is another button beside the mic icon to insert a fullstop and you willl get your 5 stars back!
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"Certainly the best for typing, the only thing I would like you to improve in a upcoming update is maybe a few more themes?
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"As petty as it sounds I would love a red keyboard to match the rest of my phone's theme and case!
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"All we need is Chinese input (I prefer strokes)
",info
lensix,ratingone,"No word prediction in various browsers.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"No dedicated # row option either.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"If only you can move cursor by sliding finger accros the keyboard, not with arrows.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"It's been MONTHS since hundreds if not thousands of users faithfully and trustingly waiting for the additional of Chinese language support.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"But with more languages added,Chinese never made the list.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"SwiftKey makes my typing hella fast and easier but there need to have a Chinese input..
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"1 suggestion, pls add more theme for this app
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"If they could integrate a bit of slide like FlexT9 it would be unbeatable.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"Auto correct and predictions only work on few apps for jelly bean.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"Can't even get it for the default browser.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"Also, when I have the keyboard enabled, it for some reason disables the handwriting feature in the Samsung Keyboard for the Note 2
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"I like this a lot more than the standard key pad thing, would get 5 stars if you added swype.
",info
lentwo,ratingfive,"More themes!
",info
leneight,ratingone,"I can download any language except for English.
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"**still not saving any new words!!
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"Seems to have totally forgotten a lot of my saved words.
",info
leneighteen,ratingtwo,"Also if I type too fast it just deletes the word and I have to type it again.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"Changed to three stars because it loves the battery.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"Cut my S III's battery time almost in half.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"PLZ make more themes n can u make the key board look like adapt keyboards plz make the key board respond faster
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"EXELENT BUT NO WWW
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"My only gripe is that when I hit close to the 'i'  key I sometimes hit the 'u' key instead,  and i never use u for you so this bothers me.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"It doesn't support one hand operation which is so essential for the giant screen of Note 2.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"I use the swipe on android and this keyboard  dont have it
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"I don't like how laggy it can be sometimes.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"It is especially bad when I switch between numbers/symbols and letters.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"I also have speed issues when I'm touch typing like I would on the normal android keyboard.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"But PLEASE add swipe right as a redo. (swipe left deletes a word,  so swipe left undoes that deletion).
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"I often find myself accidentally deleting words...
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"Its take so much time for pop up and its typing speed is slow
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"The predictions don't show up and it won't auto correct my words.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"My version has a few misspelled words that it automatically displays in the predictions window. Cannot edit the dictionary to remove them.
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"SmartSpace is terrible, unadjustable, and too invasive.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"FYI: SwiftKey doesn't like the Moto LapDock at all.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"Certain behaviors like automatic spacing after periods are a pain in the @$$ when trying to type in my email address that has periods in it.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"An option that disables automatic spacing after punctuation is necessary.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"I would also like to see an option to edit the personal dictionary.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"Its a great keyboard however I wish it suppoerted the samsung swipe.
",info
lentwenty,ratingtwo,"As mentioned in title, please consider to add numeric key at top row, this will significantly improve the typing speed
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"Bug: when typing words beginning with a capital letter on Firefox, that word won't be written
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"And plz provide new themes.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"Sometimes the auto predict won't even come up when you're texting/typing.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfour,"Some of the minor problems I have with it are the fact that the keyboard wants to insert an I if you hit enter after a period.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"I like the fact that it can predict my words but I rarely start a sentence with I.
",info
lenforty,ratingfour,"Also some of the words it will allow me to type and won't correct are some of the most mispelled words, although there are only a handful and the keyboard will learn which words you use and don't.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"I love this keyboard, but since updating to 4.2.1, I've got performance issues.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"First, the keyboard takes too long to show up  second, the keyboard lags when typing rapidly (it used to be buttery smooth).
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"Would have been great to receive the incompatibility warning PRIOR to paying.
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"The auto space after a full-stop is ridiculous. Allow the option to turn it off.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"It keeps inserting words I don't want.
",info
lentwo,ratingone,"Limited dictionary.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"Costs me way more effort than the std keyboard because I have to go back constantly to correct.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"Just little niggles like not working correctly in Chrome like user name and captchas.
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"Emoji support would be awesome please.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"This is an outstanding app and I would give it a 5 rating if they can add: (1) Swipe functionality and (2) More keyboard themes.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"The current set of themes lack the look and feel.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"Keeps saying it saved me 10,000 keystroke but it doesnt take into account the 50,000 it missed.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"Doesnt even put an apostrophe on the doesnt in this critique.
",info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Just lacking the ! shortcut now.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"I can't fix typos often when I already have typed other words.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"I'll go back to fix it and when I press the backspace button, it adds chucks of words instead of erasing.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"Also, when typing in all capitals, the auto correct is very bad. Especially the first one.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"Rarely has a hiccup, but some keys I'd rather have on the main board.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfive,"Speaking of which though, I wish there was Japanese and Chinese available so I don't have to keep switching keyboards just to type those!
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Please add more themes
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"Great app but you lose the ability to add standard Samsung characters, like the hearts for example.
",info
lenfour,ratingthree,"Also no personal dictionary.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"What about being able to learn from whatsapp as I do most of the typing there (most of the people do).
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"We also need Italian keyboard layout
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"I gave it a 4 because I thought it would have more color customization.
",info
lenthree,ratingone,"Need Thai language
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"Dude where are the themes!??
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingthree,"When I just had the trial version the app worked like a charm but now it freezes from time to time for no apparent reason.
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingthree,"I am forced to exit the program and start over from the beginning-sending emails is even worse - in landscape view it is almost impossible to see what you are writing
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that we can't type in Chinese!!!
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingfour,"I mean, there's even languages I have never heard of, but not Chinese mandarin...oh and another, at times it doesn't automatically autocorrect and a word such as ""gjakdn"" will pass
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"Tle letter for arabic keyboard is small very difficult to write
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"Only thing I'd change is more theme options
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"After my Galaxy Nexus got updated to 4.2, the keyboard was gone.Not just gone as default keyboard, but removed uninstalled.
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"The basic s-pen function is not there and you have to revert back to the basic android application.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I commonly have the problem that it will not do predictions in landscape mode.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"Need a button to toggle predictions.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"Now it's just like any other keyboard, not keeping my regularly used terms in its dictionary.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"It's lacking customisation to make it efficient enough to compete with Swype which makes touch typing feel like swimming.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"The auto correction is totally busted(makes you write like a retard)
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"The setup is overly complicated and confusing.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"Please add a vibrate setting like the stock Android keyboard.
",info
lenfiftyfour,ratingfour,"I have noticed that the standard Samsung keyboard method will come back every now and then and I have to swipe to get the notification center and change back to ""SwiftKey 3"" from ""Samsung keyboard"" on my Galaxy S3. It will happen every time I restart the phone and then try to text or anything else.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"On occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"I am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to Facebook. It renders it useless anytime I see something Facebook worthy.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"The only problem I have with this keyboard is that sometimes it will interpret my fast typing as a deletion swipe, which can be frustrating -
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"It doesnt work with fb chat... which is the ideal situation to make use of fast typing and auto correct.
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingfive,"the only improvement that SwiftKey needs is the ability to paste into whatsapp - to do this right now i have to switch to the Samsung keyboard and hold the 123? Button to paste.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"The keyboard layout is not to my liking and cannot be changed much...
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"If I just press space bar many times it writes a long sentence somebody else wrote me in an email...
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"There is a ton if lag!
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"I start to type and it doesn't register until seconds later and I've already written a paragraph.
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"Eats a ton of RAM.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"Major issues with Chrome fields.... Jumps all over the place, erases characters.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"Personally I find I type less accurately with this keyboard than the stock one.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"Also don't like the numbers/characters panel.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"The option to have a more classic looking one wouldn't go amiss.
",info

",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"I really love the keyboard,  I came from and iPhone and it's been quite the easy switch because of SwiftKey.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"It's quite annoying,  and also the reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"Make an option to toggle this setting,  please!

",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"It's a great keyboard! :-)
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"This app has saved me over 10k keystrokes according to its statistics since I bought it 4 months ago!

lentwenty,ratingfive,"Once I got used the to the interface I really don't know how I could live without it now!
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"Not so good compare to SwiftKey 1. Or maybe it's this Samsung galaxy 3 I'm using.

lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"Had SwiftKey 1 with my HTC Desire hd the SwiftKey keyboard appeared with the prediction bar when I'm on the Internet browser.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Samsung swipe keyboard used to be great on S1.

",non-info
lenseven,ratingthree,"Really makes my phone sluggish whilst installed
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"I was surprised at how well this keyboard worked.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Predictions and accuracy are second to none.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"I got this during one of the holiday discounts but I would have gladly paid full price.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"No problems, quick to learn, and will learn how you type.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"SwiftKey word predictions is amazing.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"What I love the most is that it learns the words in my own language that I typed.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"My local words also appear as predictions.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Worth every cent.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I love to text quickly and sometimes I make small errors in keystrokes.

",non-info
lentwo,ratingone,"Money sucker.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"I love this app!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Worth every penny!
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Perfect to replace the crappy auto correct that comes with the S3.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Been using since beta, best keyboard app out there with this release.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Puts the stock autocorrect to shame! !
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Well worth the money to upgrade.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"This keyboard works amazingly well!
",non-info
lenthirtyfive,ratingfive,"It's making me a lazy texter as I don't have to get many letter right in a word for it to correct it correctly, it works better than anything I've ever tried.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Been looking for a new keyboard with more options.... This one was it!!
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"No complaints for this keyboard.
",non-info

",non-info
lentwo,ratingfour,"definitely perfection!
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"I'm faster on this than I am on my computer, in fact in took me a couple seconds to write this.

lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I find that I can type without looking at the keyboard which is amazing.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"trust me money well spent.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"It freaky how it knows what you want type.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"I want it work on my lap top same way!
",non-info
lenthirtyseven,ratingfive,"I haven't used this keyboard in awhile due to being satisfied with the jellybean keyboard on my galaxy nexus, however since getting the RAZR M I've started to look for alternatives and stopped at SwiftKey.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Can't wait for SwiftKey flow.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"The new flow option is also awesome.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"You won't regret it!
",non-info
lenten,ratingthree,"without that, you might be left behind in the race.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingtwo,"The developer knows about it, but doesn't do anything about it!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingone,"So, I downloaded the trial app and fell in love with this setup over my factory SIII keyboard.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingone,"I used until trial period ran out, then purchased the app.
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"Downloaded to make life easier, not so much.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Better than default keyboard
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"The best app I have downloaded.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"As nice as the original SwiftKey was the new slide is way, way better!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Word predictions are good.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Waiting for SwiftKey Flow to get a full release!
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"It would be better if these things are fixed, but i can live without those problems getting in my way.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Still 5 stars, good job devs!
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"3 stars for your best work and another 2 will be given to you after fulfillment of my demands
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"It fixes all my mistakes and even knows what I am about to write.

lenfour,ratingfive,"Awesome app works perfect
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"When this app actually comes up on my screen when I go to type something I love it.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"Only app ive ever spent money on and ever reviewed for that matter, but this app is worth it.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Keyboard works really well, especially for those who type quickly.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Literally memorizes how u usually respond to people.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"All around a great upgrade from the regular keyboard.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"There is a reason its the top paid app in the app store.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"My typing speed has increased considerably with this app and making less mistakes.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"I type in English and Spanish and the app makes accurate predictions on both languages simultaneously.

",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"Great keyboard for typing fast.
",non-info
lensix,ratingtwo,"I use to live this app.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I try a lot of different keyboards.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"I loved swype but this is even better.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"It's a very good idea and app, but the smarter it got, the Mora annoyed I've got.
",non-info
lenten,ratingthree,"It tries to guess words and can get really annoying..

",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"It's awesome no regrets
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Flipping amazing keyboard that just knows what you are going to type.
",non-info
lennine,ratingone,"Makes the whole point of the tablet version redundant.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingone,"Use Thumb Keyboard instead - at least it delivers what it promises.
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"Swiftkey is a waste of money, developers unresponsive
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Easy to use, great features set, brilliant
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"It really helps me typing fast without many errors

lenfive,ratingfive,"The auto correct is flawless!
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"I am very happy satisfied with this keyboard.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Don't even get me started on the predictive text!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Other than that I love this app
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"This app lays waste to all built in or aftermarket keyboards.
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"It's customizable, and it learns your writing style, and vocabulary, and the predictions are on the spot from the very beginning.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"At least try the free version, but either way you will not be displeased.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I never spend money on apps...ever.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"This one was an exception because I was blown away.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"This app makes my keyboard use so much easier.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Try it, buy it, just get it.

lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Makes typing a breeze on my HTC Explorer which has a small screen.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"The team is very responsive to any issues.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"I love SwiftKey.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"This keyboard has made my texting on a touch phone really easy and fast!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Sometimes I don't even need to edit what I type cause this app corrects it for me!
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I have tried the free trial at first, figuring the trial might end.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"So I bought the app when it was on a promotion for just 99 cent!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Original price is 3.99!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingone,"It is extremely frustrating.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingone,"Galaxy Note 2.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"I absolutely love this keyboard app.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Other than that, top rated keyboard.
",non-info

",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Highly recommended!

lenfour,ratingone,"Huge waste of money!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingone,"Galaxy S3 with sprint.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"I'm typing this reviwy blazing fast right now!
",non-info
leneight,ratingthree,"I used the trial version for a month.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"It learned my typing style and i had my settings tweaked perfectly.
",non-info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"Lots of people complain that the program inputs a space after a period automatically. I complained about it too until i got use to not having to input spaces.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Now this program is saveing me hundreds of keystrokes a week.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"And a must have app for the galaxy s3 which has no autocorrect.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Literally bought this after sending ONE text with the trial version.
",non-info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"I questioned never getting a touch smart phone again because of how much time I waste just trying to get the terrible Samsung keyboard to write what I want; problem solved!
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"It's so much faster to swipe to type!
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Still it blows every other keyboard out of the water.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingthree,"I like it's ability to predict what I'm writing.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Nicer, bigger keyboard, better predictions.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Definitely my favouritekeyboard in  landscape format
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"This is the best keyboard I have ever seen and used!
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"I've had it for quite a while now, it is worth the few bucks you have to pay for it.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"I know I wouldn't text without it!
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I type interchangeably between english and spanish, and it is absolutely SEAMLESS.
",non-info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"I just keep my keyboard in qwerty(espa?ol), and the only difference this makes is when you hold down vowels you can get accents, and there is one extra button (?).
",non-info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"I can actually switch languages mid sentence (without having to change a setting or push a button or anything) and it will start predicting and correcting in that language.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Its language detection is amazing, and never gets in your way.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Keep it up dev team!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"A well deserved number 1 app on Android.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Only stayed on the free version for 2 hours and had to purchase.
",non-info

",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Favorite keyboard.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Try the new ""swype"" download for SwiftKey.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"This is the only app I have ever bought.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"I first downloaded the free trial but once that ran out, I had to have the full version.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"It predicts not only words but sentences.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"Not a big deal for me but it looks bad when someone's watching my phone.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"The predictions are depressingly accurate.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"The interface and special key layout are the best I've seen.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"Easy to use, the more you use it the better it gets.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"Please fix! RAZR M, JB 4.1.1.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"EDIT: After several reboots and deleting app data, sk3 seems to be stable again.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"Frustrating since I had to delete all of the learned suggestions, but it's back so I'm happy.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Also very useful for polyglot people (no need to switch languages ever again)
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Hmmm.......Guess the app is that good
",non-info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"Stock keyboard, just as good.
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"We waited months for 4.1 and it's impossible to tell how long it will take to get 4.2 especially for international users.
",non-info
lentwentyeight,ratingthree,"Everyone here paid good money for the app please look for a work around other then waiting for 4.2 to be released only then will I give it 5 stars.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"The two stars that are missing reflect developer involvement to solve a known issue.

",non-info
lenten,ratingfour,"Couldn't ask for a more perfect look and feel.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"I had such a hard time typing on my new gs3, because I am so used to a physical keyboard.

lennine,ratingfive,"I best app I have ever purchased bar none.

leneight,ratingfive,"You'll think how you ever lived without!

",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"I switched to android and struggled with the stock keyboard.
",non-info

",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"I love this application
",non-info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"Not only does it predict what I say from SMS & Gmail very well but I love the press & hold character feature, saves so much time instead OF switching screens.

lennine,ratingtwo,"Gets two stars because of the good theme options.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"This keyboard is the best app I have ever spent money on.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Definitely worth the money.

",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"I don't always use this keyboard, I much prefer Swype for one handed use when I'm on the go.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"But SwiftKey is extremely useful for two handed use

lenthree,ratingfive,"Totally worth it.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"Multilingual support and amazing predictive ability (seriously -  sometimes I don't even need to type!).

",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"very smart and very fast with predictions. definitely a must download app!
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"in my opinion its better than swype, it will be even better once SwiftKey flow comes out on gapp store. a+++

",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"I have contacted the developers about this problem and they were nothing but useless!
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"No help what so ever, they came off as if they did not believe me.
",non-info
lentwentysix,ratingone,"It is a real shame because the application had great potential but when developers do NOT keep up with bugs, it goes down hill very fast.

",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"I am 55 and tried different keyboards before but love this one.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Bought thumb keyboard before which I did not like.

",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I wish Google to purchase this one and keep as default keyboard.

",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"No words.. Simply the bestest
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"I love this keyboard, it has ruined me for other mobile devices and even my pc keyboard.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"This is the best keyboard I've used on Android.
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"My favorite feature is that the period, comma, exclamation mark, and question mark all share the same key (with the period key as primary).
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"Numbers are available on their own alternate keyboard with a rich number of other symbols as well.
",non-info
lensix,ratingthree,"Especially if this application costs money.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Definitely best keyboard.

",non-info
lenthree,ratingone,"Basically useless keyboard.
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"Best app I've ever bought hands down the original auto correct for me Samsung s3 is garbage this app is untouchable to the rest
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfour,"Otherwise not bad...
",non-info
lennine,ratingfour,"Samsung could learn a couple things from this keyboard.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"This is a great keyboard, it works very well.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Worth the several bucks for sure!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Better than the ios keyboard this is well worth the money as more features eg different keyboard sizes.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Truely impressed and saves me time correcting my mistakes.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"Also, if you mess up and lose a comment you were in the middle of, SwiftKey can remember it.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Best keyboard I've ever used.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"It really is crazy how good it is at guessing what you're typing.
",non-info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"From a die hard swype user that was crushed when he got the DNA and saw how bad HTC's slide keyboard is, this is well worth your money. A++
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"Takes a few days to get used to, but an awesome tool once you get the hang of it!
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"Great app. Reads my mind.
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"This is the best keyboard app that I've have used especially when you are using this keyboard across multiple device

lenthree,ratingfive,"Worth every penny
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"It makes typing a lot easier great app very satisfied :)
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"I never rate an app but this one I had to!
",non-info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"The way its laid out is perfect and its the only keyboard iv found that has the numbers set up like a10 key pad.

",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Moving up to your brother, SwiftKey Flow.

leneight,ratingfive,"Much better predictability and customization than Samsung keyboard
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Without this app, I would switch to the iPhone.
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"I can see this working for some people, but I couldnt type for the life of me on this keyboard.
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingthree,"Just switched from an iPhone 4S, so it may just take getting used to, but I have zero issues witht the standard Android keyboard FWIW.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingthree,"Overall just kinda meh
",non-info
lennine,ratingfour,"That's a feature I use all the time.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"The best typing experience ever.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"I sell phones for a living.
",non-info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"And I've told EVERY and any customer that comes in and just isn't sure about a certain phone because of having issues with texting accuracy about SwiftKey keyboard.

",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Well worth the money.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"So happy I found this app and then purchased it while on Sale.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfour,"Way better than the stock gs3 keyboard.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Probably the best App I have ever bought, Android or OIS...
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"I generate whole texts with only ever pushing a few keys.
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"Intuitive responses that are so accurate, it makes me question if this App is actually programmed using Black Magic and Virgin Sacrifices...
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Gave the trial a go and found it far superior to the stock app.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"So I bought it, brilliant and intuitive.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfour,"This is a great improvement on the Android keyboard.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"I really love this keyboard!
",non-info
lentwentyseven,ratingfive,"I was a little hesitant about purchasing a keyboard to replace the stock keyboard in my Samsung Galaxy S III, but I am really glad I did!

lennine,ratingfive,"This the best virtual keyboard in the Android world!
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"I'm kinda bored with the current ones :)
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"By far the best typing app on the market hands down!
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"You will never use anything else once you start to use this app.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingtwo,"App sucks.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"Only thing good thing about it is the custom color options.

",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Really happy with this keyboard!
",non-info
lentwo,ratingtwo,"Wayyyy better.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Highly recommended.

",non-info
lennine,ratingthree,"I'll gice it 5 star's when works again.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Really good keyboard & excellent predictive & autocorrect engine with this app!
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Much more intuitive than the standard android keyboard & /or swype!
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Hooked after just a few days!
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"One of those apps you just install when you get a new device.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"I've had it for 20 minutes and I already love it, can't wait for flow!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Now after this update, SwiftKey deserve 5 stars
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Please fix ASAP, love this keyboard!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingone,"I switched to AnySoftKeyboard.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Keyboard on android ;-)
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"buy this app five stars worth every penny.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Super easy and simple.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"This is my favorite app and it works very well with the exception of one thing.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"I just installed Swiftkey Flow Beta and it also works swimmingly but with the same caveat.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Now this is what you call an app.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Fantastic,have made my life heck lot easier.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Typing was never so easy nor fun, but thank to developer, it is.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Messaging, email, chatting they all are so good now.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"Would recommend it to everybody, jus buy and leave that one pizza for a day.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"U won't regret.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"A request to Google, please incorporate this in the next android update.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"If there's only one app you need to buy, this is definitely it.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"So, I downloaded the trial app and fell in love with this setup over my factory SIII keyboard.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingthree,"I used until trial period ran out, then purchased the app.
",non-info
leneight,ratingthree,"Downloaded to make life easier, not so much.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Have been using it for the past one year.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"The latest version, makes it the best keyboard in the market right now.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Proven again why you chaps are the best in the market.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Typing with pleasure, should be your new motto.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Great work guys.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Best keyboard App
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"This keyboard just keeps getting better and better, if you are debating the purchase, I can't recommend this enough.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"It has the most customization compared to any of the other ones I have tried (Swift, Stock, Hackers...)
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Well worth whatever price they are asking.
",non-info
leneight,ratingtwo,"...but after last update it's total crap!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingtwo,"I'm using Croatian layout and we used to have Croatian letters underneath regular i.e. long press.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingtwo,"If you can't fix this (that ? is under c, ? is under z, etc) please refund me.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingtwo,"I'm sorry for one star, but this is completely your fault.
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"Even in this version without flow.
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"Now this app becomes completely useless.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"First, flow is amazing.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Great job.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"One thing I'm confused on how to do is write words like 'too' using the flow method.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Every time I try it comes out with only one 'o'.
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"I've tried moving my finger in circles on the O key but I can't get it to work.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Anyone found a way to solve this problem???
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Its really annoying and it's my only complaint!
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Been using this keyboard for ages, best keyboard on Android.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I was skeptical that this could learn from previous texts,  but it really does.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Even silly terms that I use with family members are picked up on.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"Great replacement to the stock keyboard, love the predictions it saves a lot of typing for me.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"I would kill for this keyboard.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"This is simply the best keyboard on android, and the new flow is even better.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"The default keyboard on my phone is alright, but a friend told me to try this out.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"It is much better than the standard keyboard on my Xperia S.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"The auto correct is a god send and the predictions can make some pretty good sentences.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Worth the small price tag for a great app.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Don't think I can ever use another on screen keyboard again
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"It auto corrects when I think it should have already learnt a word.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"I was a Droid 2 Global user, because of the ""real"" keyboard...
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"And switched to a virtual one...
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"It was terrible, as i have big thumbs, and kept typing the wrong letters...
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Swiftkey saved my cellphone experience!
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"This is the absolute best keyboard I've tried!!!
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"The only thing stopping this keyboard being the perfect Android keyboard are these two issues.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Tried it, liked it, bought it, love it.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"It's like I never gave up my full keyboard
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Simply amazing!!!
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"It's a great keyboard, and the upcoming Flow option is great!
",non-info
lennine,ratingfour,"Not the worst or unbearable, but just not great.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfour,"The Flow line looks very nice, almost looks out of place
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Ok so I'm an avid Swype guy but love SwiftKey's predictive text.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"The beta of Flow is truly brilliant.
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"Being able to mix multiple languages so easily together with the great and accurate predictions makes this my favourite app on Android, hands down.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Keep up the great work guys!
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Amazing application.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"The very best keyboard app i've ever used
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"This is an excellent choice for a keyboard.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Thanks SwiftKey
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfour,"Not going to lie, should be 5 stars.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"This app my texts have immediately improved I am amazed by the word predictions.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"I was a iphone user.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"In the past two weeks I've could easily switch!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Worth every penny when the trial ended!
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"Prediction is the best and does not try to correct most text lingo when you need a message to be short!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Best keyboard, period.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Awesome keyboard I don't think that there is a better keyboard.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"Just downloaded SwiftKey Flow Beta as I've use and loved SwiftKey for a long time.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"It's swype for SwiftKey.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"I was never into swiping until Armando on YouTube used it in his android tutorials.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Picked this up and I'm in love.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"I love SwiftKey and I definitely love SwiftKey Flow!
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Great app.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"The flow beta is fantastic!
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I'm typing five times as fast as normal with barely any mistakes.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Great job guys!
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Great app
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Best keyboard available.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Love the new swipe feature in the beta!
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Constantly improving.
",non-info
lentwentyfive,ratingfive,"The default Samsung Galaxy S3 keyboard was driving me crazy - I was making tons of typos everywhere, much more so than when I had an iPhone.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Since switching to SwiftKey 3, all those typos are history \o/
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"It makes typing so much easier to type.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfour,"I haven't seen any keyboards with that yet.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfour,"My girlfriend is taiwanese and she uses my phone a lot.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Love swift key best keyboard I've ever used and I've tried tons!
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"Took a bit to get used to the slider but I don't even notice anymore and LOVE the new pink theme!....
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Freakishly accurate at times.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I'm really looking to the flow update to go with it.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Great app.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Way better than the default keyboard
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Much better than the standard Samsung keyboard!!
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Predictive text works a lot better and more efficiently.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Best keyboard I've used, and it learns super fast!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"I also like the fact that it includes arrows for easy navigation through the text I've typed.
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"I had heard good things about it from other people, but it has been waaaay better than I expected it to be.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Works better than all the other keyboards I've used.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I'm now using the Flow beta.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"I bought this app last night and I've already bought it for two friends.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"As others have said, the predictive text is amazingly accurate.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"Before using SwiftKey 3, I cursed the ""auto-text / auto-speller"" on every phone I've owned.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Also, the shortcuts for entering punctuation and emoticons are big time-savers.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"And so far, the voice-to-text feature has been just as great.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Maybe the best $4 I've spent in years.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"No other keyboard even comes close to this one.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Tried living without it for a few days, but I gotta have it back.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Personally, its thebest keyboard in the market!
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Keep up th good work devs!
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Easily one of the best keyboards I've used!
",non-info
lenfive,ratingone,"I paid for this app.
",non-info
lennine,ratingone,"I would give it negative stars if I could
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"This is an amazing app.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I am now writing my books on my phone because of this.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfour,"I can type so much faster now.
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"I was skeptical at first but this is by far the fastest and most accurate keyboard I have EVER used.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"I wish I would have bought this long ago.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"The prediction is spot on.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"I came from an iOS background and dealt with that horrendous typing experience for years.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Then I got an android phone, and I was impressed with the stock keyboard.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"This, however, blows stock out of the water and into the frying pan.
",non-info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"The word suggestions are by far the best feature (and it actually works, unlike autocorrect) but being able to long-tap for extra characters is really useful too.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Truly awesome.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfour,"By far the best keyboard on Android.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Love this keyboard.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Google needs to put in a bid for this company.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Seriously, make this a permanent Android feature.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Love this keyboard.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"It's saved me over 100,000 keystrokes since installation earlier this year.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Highly recommend this.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"Can't wait for swiftkey flow... swype typing is coming and from this developer it'll be great
",non-info
lenten,ratingone,"I paid 4$ for this app less then a month ago.
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"They should refund people's money.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingone,"25 cent sell, slap in the face to all that paid full price.
",non-info

",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"The app appears to be reading my mind about the next words I want to type.
",non-info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"I had this the Editor's Choice version of this app installed on the Samsung Galaxy Note i717 running Ice Cream Sandwich and it worked beautifully.
",non-info
lennine,ratingone,"Yesterday I bought the Samsung Galaxy Note II (SGH-1317).
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingone,"I have tried installing and uninstalling this app on my new phone since I bought it yesterday afternoon with no luck.
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"However, my network connection is working just fine.
",non-info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"I tried every app on the phone that requires a network connection to see if there was a problem on any other app.
",non-info
lenten,ratingone,"I even tried watching an episode of something on Netflix.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingone,"When I had this app installed on my Samsung Galaxy Note i717, I would easily have given it five stars.
",non-info
lennine,ratingone,"I hope the problem will be fixed very soon.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingone,"Swiftkey, please comment or advise.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"You're a very good app SwiftKey, but I had to uninstall you.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I'm leaving you for SwiftKey flow!
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Quite simply the fastest and best keyboard available
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"Was sceptical that this new keyboard could do anything that my stock keyboard couldn't and the price tag did not help.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"I am quite surprised at this app, well pleased and 100x better than the stock android keyboard.
",non-info
lenthirtyfive,ratingfive,"This is a great keyboard though I hope they make people who brought this upgrade to swift key flow for free since I'm now using the beta version and I am loving it now...
",non-info
lenfortytwo,ratingfive,"I am crap at spelling and grammar and this does it all for me is learning how I speak in txt and my txt, emails are getting faster and faster this app is the dogs bollocks and worth every penny and more
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Just tried out the beta flow version of this app and I am pleased.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Can't wait for it to come out of beta.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Gonna be the best keyboard in the play store without a doubt
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Great app, much better keyboard than Samsung's effort.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"It's like an improved keyboard from my old HTC Desire, which was hard to fault anyway.
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"Had a little trouble upgrading from the trial but I got a swift response (5 minutes!) in my email which sorted everything.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"5 stars well deserved.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Cool its a great app
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"When I return to my desktop, iOS devices, anything else, I want the auto-completion SwiftKey provides.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingthree,"It's elementary and ridiculous.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingthree,"I don't like it.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"So I downloaded and bought Swiftkey3 and I love it.
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"I just downloaded Swift key flow and it is amazing if it gets good reviews and can buy it I highly recommend you do
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Anything else is ok.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Worth the low price and I'm cheap
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"Best keyboard out there Imo.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingone,"Used to be the best - now stock us better and quicker.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"It's actually the best keyboard currently for Android.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Much much better than the original keyboard.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"I can completely misspell a word and it figure out what it's supposed to be.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"This is hands down the greatest keyboard on a phone iv ever used.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Otherwise I'm never typing wth anything else ever again haha cheers..
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"At first, I had a difficult time in learning about, how to type with this.
",non-info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"But after going through with the settings, I saw that there is an option to let this software read through my sms', emails', tweets' content, and identify patterns.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Now I don't have to type, 'Honey,  I'm on my way'.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I just have to type, hon and honey with capital letters H appears.
",non-info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfive,"I just have to tap on it, and one by one other wordings of I'm on my way home appears, and all I have to do then is, tap on each of them.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"No longer will I be making ridiculous typos like in the title of the this review!
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Only been using this app for a day but I'm VERY impressed!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"I've never typed so fast on a phone before and I've got a lot of practice!
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Wish I had bought this earlier!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingthree,"Feels sluggish sometimes...
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"Holy hwll this is more annoying than anything.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"By far the best keyboard app ever!
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"Coming from a full qwerty slider, this app has relieved most of my annoyance with having to type on a touchscreen.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"Its ability to make predictions for several languages simultaneously is a big deal, and missing in most competing products.
",non-info
lennine,ratingthree,"This is a brilliant app for predicting words etc....
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"This app is a must have I make sure I have it installed on every android phone I get.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Always remembers everything i wrote before
",non-info
lennine,ratingfour,"It's so awesome how well the prediction is.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"In fact, you can get rid of the keys altogether and just have one big pad.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"We all know what the keyboard layout is.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Much better than any stock keyboard.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Its prediction and auto correct are much better than any other keyboard I've used, stock or not.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"But I'm still going to rate this keyboard 5 stars.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"It's simply the best keyboard around and I love that you can change themes, keeps everything feeling fresh.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"I heard 4.1.2 update fixes the default keyboard issue so I'll just have to wait.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"I'm astounded by this app.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Love this keyboard, my Samsung keyboard sucks
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfour,"Great app.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Best keyboard on the app store, unparalleled accuracy for the prediction
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"A wonderful keyboard.
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"I come from iOS and the predictions and word completions for their keyboards and their dictionary is second to none.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"SwiftKey however is rapidly approaching and is a wonderful transition.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Definitely worth the buy!
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"No comment at this time
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"For a moment i cheated on you with Go Keyboard.. but came back crawling to you.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"I love you pumpkin, you are the best
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"As soon as I upgraded from my old incredible this was the first app I reinstalled.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Best keyboard you can have no doubt.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfour,"I like this keyboard, it really learns how I write.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfour,"That is the most, second only to ""Settings"" with 44 MB.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"The next closes one is Lookout with 14 MB, just about half of what SwiftKey uses, both while idle.
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"I know there should be a lot of RAM left on most modern phone, but that is not my point.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"I have other app I rarely use, but they still use RAM for no apparent reason.
",non-info
lentwentyseven,ratingfour,"I uninstall them, I don't want to uninstall SwiftKey, but the native keyboard is catching up with SwiftKey and would have RAM usage on my phone.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"Everything else about the SwiftKey keyboard is great.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"For most people how only istall a few Apps SwiftKey is a must install.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"I am not like most people, I try and use a lot of apps.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"Most people don't notice it, but if you do, it really starts to bug you!
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"...feature then I may return but since GS3 JB update enabled Swype keyboard using that instead.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Other than that it's an awesome keyboard!!
",non-info
lensix,ratingfour,"This is a really convenient app--
",non-info
lenten,ratingfour,"I was getting super frustrated with my Samsung S3s auto type.
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"This saved me so much typing, it remembers your word patterns so that it can even guess whole sentences word by word!
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfour,"I love when apps know me, and spell how I spell =)
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"Now that I have a tablet, I wish I didn't have to pay extra for that, too...
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Best keyboard in the market
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Very nice keyboard....
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Does a better job than any other keyboard I've tried....
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"Even ICS and JB stock keyboards do this.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"I never buy apps and bc of how great the trial version was i bought the full version.
",non-info
lennine,ratingthree,"A very good keyboard and the prediction is excellent.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"It is good but I feel like typing should be flawless on a keyboard.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Simply superb.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Easy to use and makes typing so much quicker.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Oh, and you can't do this on an iPhone!
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"But I seriously can't wait till Swift key Flow comes out!!!
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfour,"Not perfect, but I miss it when it's not installed...
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I don't hate typing on my phone as much as I used to.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"This is my personal favorite keyboard.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"The prediction is amazing.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Simply the best keyboard.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Switched from slideit.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Totally worth it.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"And you can use different dictionaries without having to switch the whole time!
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Highly recommended.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I love this keyboard I will never use another crappie android keyboard again!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"No issues whatsoever.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"If you come from iOs, you know the day and night different between the two stock keyboards.
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"Android keyboard is suck but I can assure u that this keyboard will make your life on Android phone a lot better.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Truly great keyboard.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"The predictions are stunningly accurate.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"My favourite feature is that it can handle more than one language.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"No need to switch manually.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Best keyboard i've used.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"It predicts what I want to write.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"Plus it's really useful to write using with different languages at the same time!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"This app used to be great, it would accurately predict when I was typing all over the place.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"100x better than the default keyboard for Android
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"I hated my keyboard when I went from s2 to s3 but after downloading I have a new love for my phone again. :-)
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"thanks a must download.!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"At first I regretted making the switch.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"The s3 keyboard is garbage.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"With this keyboard its beast, text just like I phone and super easy to use.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"It makes you coherent when otherwise you wouldn't be.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"The best at predictions beating Android native because it adds and learns new words automatically rather than manual adding.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Predictions surprisingly accurate based on historic usage of words together.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Worth the money.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Lots of options.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Just gone from Galaxy SII to Note II and it helps to be able to adjust key height.
",non-info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"By the way for the review saying you can't remove words that you don't use, you can by long pressing and clicking remove on the predictions
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"Defiantly would recommend this keyboard to anyone that would like to be more effective typing on touchscreens.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Very small problems when compared to this amount of effort and time that this keyboard has saved me.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"It is an excellent app, and it learns really quickly..
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"it looks good, and gives your keyboard a nice finish..
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"worth buying
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"I've been using this for over a year, and of all the apps I use, this is probably the most essential.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Its an awesome keyboard to replace the built in ones
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Finally I could text.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Love the keyboard!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Now I'm just waiting on FLOW!
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Can't wait for Flow!
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Love this app on my note 2
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"I'm not a typer but this app makes me look like I've been doing it all my life.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Great app.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Had the free version loaded for about a month.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"It only made my typing more efficient.
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"They have stats in the app to illustrate the improvement - but it's not too hard to see on your own.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"But it does it's job freakishly well.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Well worth the keesh.
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"it just works, I don't even have to press the space button and it still knows what I'm saying!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"The theme is awesome
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Awesome auto correct, fast to type on.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Reliable and easy to use.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Can't wait for flow
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Release swift key flow alreadyyyyyy!
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingone,"No where near as accurate as they fake it in the video.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"One of the first things they teach you about Android is to look at permissions for apps.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"This is true for both malicious apps and legitimate apps that could cause security concerns.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingone,"The trade off for this security concern is text prediction no better than any other keyboard.
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"Be smart and avoid this one.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"I have had this keyboard in he past and have yet to find another quite like this one.
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingtwo,"It's well known that it's a poor business practice to make your existing customers suddenly pay more to use an existing product.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"Suddenly charging existing customers for use on tablets smacks of lousy business acumen.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"I've been using this for a fair few months now and it's fantastic!
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Highly recommend.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I can write whole texts pretty much by just typing one word!
",non-info
lennine,ratingfour,"Doesn't happen in other keyboards on the market :-(
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"For the support team.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Very kind and accurate, I have really appreciate the quick answer.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"The keyword is awesome, makes me feel like I speak languages I don't ;)
",non-info
lensix,ratingthree,"Which is already became sms replacement....
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Truly changes the way my android device handles my typing styles on various formats.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Other than that, a superb app!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Money well spent!
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"The best taxting apps on the market I recommend this to everyone.
",non-info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"I haven't used this keyboard for that long but it feels like I have been missing out all this time when I was using the other third party keyboards.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"Since using this app it haven't changed a phrase that I use to something completely different.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Keep up the good work because I'm happy that I purchased this app.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfour,"I love how accurite it is when I type.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"I'm a rapid texter and this is so much better than the stock keyboard from Android.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfour,"I have the Galaxy Nexus, with the AOKP ROM.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Better than factory installed.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Finally a keyboard that suits me!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Thank you! Brilliant!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I highly recommend it this to anyone.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Works much better than the pre installed keyboard on my galaxy s3.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Persian language ia awesome.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Hi Persians (Iranians) ;-)
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Great keyboard.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Freekishly accurate!!
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"My friends couldn't believe that everything came out 100 percent accurate when typing like.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"Google voice input enters al words correctly but hardly inserts any fullstop or comma.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"This is the best keyboard I have found on here and I have had many!
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"Using the 'pumpkin' theme at the moment as it is the closest one to my theme:)
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"So worth the money!!
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"It's like it knows what I'm thinking.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"The corrections are even more accurate than the iPhone keyboard.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Love the 10 key too!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Freakishly accurate at times.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I'm really looking to the flow update to go with it.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Had my Android 3 years now and this is the first app I've purchased.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"This should illustrate how great it is.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingone,"Makes no sense.
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"Company could care less about adding real functionality.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingone,"Feature requests for real functionality sit and collect dust while fluff skinning type ones get done.
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"Thank God I got it for a dime.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"It almost seems like it reads your mind.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"This keyboard does everything and can be modified to look and feel how you want!
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"This must be the first app installed on every DROID world wide
",non-info
lenten,ratingone,"I am sick of how paid users are being treated.
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingone,"Yes you may have made my money, but rest assure I will never ever recommend this app to anyone else.
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingone,"And to all other who is considering getting this app, if you like to be ignored then this is the right app for you.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"I really like this keyboard app
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I've tried so many and always come back to this one.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"And here they are with Swiftkey Flow around the corner.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"The future is very bright for this company.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfour,"I can live without it but would be a nice addition
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Love the keys
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"This is the only app I've ever bought and the only keyboard I use
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"After blasting a previous version of this app which had major usability glitches, I have to say that this is now my favourite keyboard.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Being in Montreal, I switch between French and English constantly.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Swiftkey runs both languages simultaneously so I don't actually have to switch...
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"it knows which language I'm typing in and corrects or suggests the appropriate word.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"What's amazing is how accurate the predictions are.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"In the near totality of cases, the suggested or corrected word is the right one.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"The keyboard does vibrate, it's in the settings in SwiftKey (haptic feedback) .
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"I've had SwiftKey for 2 yrs now and still love it!
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"People have been saying this forever.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingone,"Fix it, and you'll have 5 stars.
",non-info
lensix,ratingtwo,"Please fix, it's getting annoying**
",non-info
lennine,ratingtwo,"Other than that, this is the best keyboard app
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Best typing app out there.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"What can I say but with smartphones being so small I could never type right.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Now i barley have to since swift key3 was downloaded it basically types for me
",non-info
lenthree,ratingthree,"Great alternative keyboard.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"I have the Galaxy S3 and the only flaw is text.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I have huge fingers and swipe doesn't work well for me.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I was forced to hunt and peck.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Now I text just as fast as my teenage niece!
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Well worth the four bucks.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Best keyboard app out there.
",non-info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"This app is amazing work perfect only have to type like two letters and it already knows what I'm going to say.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Download it you'll love it!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Anyway,  best 4$ spent ever!
",non-info
lenten,ratingone,"Will reverie my rating and comment once it's launched
",non-info
lenfour,ratingthree,"Not worth the money.
",non-info
leneight,ratingthree,"The predictive typing is awesome and surprisingly accurate.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"I'm much faster on the normal keyboard and I'd rather just use that one.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"I could see how some people would find this useful though and it DOES save keystrokes.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Works perfectly on Note 2.... makes typing much easier and faster!
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"I really liked this app before when I had the trial version.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingthree,"worked like a charm.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"then ai bought it and all of a sudden the app sometimes doesn't even work.
",non-info
lennine,ratingthree,"its not worth all the money I paid anymore.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingthree,"fix this problem and ill rate 5 stars.
",non-info
leneight,ratingthree,"its frustrating for it to only work Sometimes.
",non-info
lenthirtyseven,ratingfive,"I haven't used this keyboard in awhile due to being satisfied with the jellybean keyboard on my galaxy nexus, however since getting the RAZR M I've started to look for alternative and stopped at SwiftKey.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Can't wait for SwiftKey flow.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Swiftkey...what a great app that works like a charm
",non-info
lenten,ratingone,"Otherwise it's a big step back from SwiftKey X.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"A truly fantastic program has been rendered just another app with with bugs.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"The best Android keyboard out there, period.
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"Within two months this thing had learned the way I type so well, that it can even when rather drunk, my texts make sense!
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"The keyboard sputtered and word prediction is amazing.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"At the same time however it's marred by it's prediction service at the same time.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"In the meantime I will be using Swype and the stock keyboard.
",non-info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"Probably the last worry on my mind when I was so use to texting on my iphone was how I would be able to text on my android.....
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"I've been using this keyboard since I brought this phone, have done trying tons of keyboard and still, return to this every time.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Otherwise, perfect!
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Looking forward to trying swiftkey flow!
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"Gets hang a lot of time.
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"Provide an update for the issue.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfour,"I would've gave it 5 stars but I can't.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Would definitely use the free trial before purchasing.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Recommend to all S3 users!
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"Very good keyboard, even better than ics keyboard.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfour,"Overall very good keyboard.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"After getting the GSIII I was a little bit unhappy with the stock Samsung keyboard and predictive text capabilities.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Without a doubt this new SwiftKey keyboard met and exceeded my requirements.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"It has made me ""50%"" more efficient and saved me ""4000 keystrokes"" in less than two months.

",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Awesome on my galaxy note

",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"EDIT: After several reboots and deleting app data, sk3 seems to be stable again.

lennine,ratingfive,"Heat map is ridiculously efficient after a few weeks..
",non-info
lenseven,ratingthree,"thought it'd be a little better.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingthree,"Especially for the price
",non-info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"The trouble I've always had with android phones is that the key boards are inaccurate and never choose the correct spelling correction.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"This app completely fixed that issue.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"The keyboard in general is more accurate and it picks the correct correction most of the time.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I've tried quite a few different keyboards, and this is the best.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"It reads my mind and corrects all my typos flawlessly.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Worth every penny.

lennine,ratingfive,"Best keyboard ever, been using it since the betas!
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingone,"Would have loved that they gave the tablet version away for free if you already purchased the one for the phone or visa versa.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,Now that I have the Note 2 it is kind of frustrating.,non-info
lenten,ratingfour,"The only thing needed is swype to make it complete :)
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"When it has 2 languages selected it mostly makes predictions in one
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"Great app very easy to use and I love the level of customisation but is does suffer from over sampling the keystrokes while the phone is being charged.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"Otherwise perfect, although this is kind of a big deal.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"I could not even personalize my writing style.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"I want it to be able to learn from whatsapp too!
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"please add emojis and other stuff
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"You might also have to change a few small settings to taylor it how you want it to auto space, period, and what not.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"Currently messes up when trying to type comments, messages etc on the mobile website version of Facebook.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"It would be better if it could be used on Google Search and on my browser.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"I just wish it worked on my Facebook..
",info
lentwenty,ratingtwo,"but lags like hell often when u wake up the phone after deep sleep and feel like smashing my phone ..
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"Great app but needs to be a little more customizable, or more themes.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"Also, a selection of copyright and trademark symbols , ?, this very important key is currently; hard to find.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"This vital key should be front and center considering the level of proprietary issues, that arise; daily, from social media postings; from general observational
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"And now it doesnt want to download the english or spanish
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"Is there anyway swift key can create a red color theme?
",info
lenthree,ratingone,"Watsapp conflict + more
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"The keyboard is great, but hard to use with one hand.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"Only thing missing for me is a <3 emoticon.
",info
lenfour,ratingone,"Punctuation key is annoying.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"Please give option for tighter or old keyboard layout.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"Arrow keys are unnecessarily large.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"1. Predictive text would be great while typing at anytime on the phone, not just for sms.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"The whole number/symbol entry screen needs to be redone.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"But one major flaw on this for a fast typer is the lack of MULTI TOUCH support.
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingthree,"And for god sake why don't you put an option to turn off ""family filter"" so i can write properly instead of seeing duck everytime i want to write something else.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I wish you could still use swype but everything else is AWESOME
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"Wish I had options to make font larger on the keys, like A.I. Keyboard.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"Wish the keyboard could show Gtalk's emoticons.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"If there is a negative comparing the 2 it would be the lack of customisation compared to smart keyboard pro, which is endless!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"It would also be nice to have more themes or support for third party themes.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"Why isn't the predictive typing working in dolphin browser?
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"I like swype but the space bar is too small.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"Here's any idea you guys should come out with different key board themes for each holiday like if you agree
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingthree,"It would be good if this paid for app would be a bit more configurable ie allow me to add an apostrophe on the main keyboard rather than have to go to the supplementary one
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"Smilies as default on the enter key are a deal breaker for me.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"Love the keyboards just Wish I could change typing sounds other than that great app!!
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"Wish they had some better looking themes
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Only thing missing is Welsh lang. Basque, Catalan, Galician, Icelandic... no Welsh?
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"Add Jelly Bean emoji support!
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"Add more keyboard skins please!!!
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"The update killed it on my thunderbolt. :( it says its turned on but I only get factory keyboard when I type
",info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"I just wish they had more language options like Japanese and Chinese, which I hope will come soon.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"I'm hoping we are getting some new Good themes!!!
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"Why they decided to put numbers on the left side and symbols on the right is beyond me (rather than numbers along the top and symbols on the rest).
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"Please continue develop the Spanish language.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"It works well but there should be an option for adding custom words to the dictionary.
",info

",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"It shows up briefly after long press(which is inconvenient too) and goes away after a fraction of a second.

lenfourteen,ratingfour,"I just took one star off because shortcuts/ personal dictionary would make it perfect.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"But continuously 'disappears.' All settings are correct but it will not appear when I need to type something!!
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Also, I'm ready for more themes.
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingthree,"Was great on my nexus s but on the Xperia u it causes quite a bit of lag on coming up and down to the point where the whole phone feels sluggish.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"That isn't to say that the dwiftkey keyboard is bad, if it weren't for the lag it would be great
",info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"What I like here is the intelligence and the prediction power, which, by the way, can be improved.
",info
lenthirtynine,ratingfive,"Now the prediction is based just on recent writing, if I go back to continue a bit older texts with special terminology I realize that all the power of prediction is gone, have to learn it again from zero..
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"And in Romanian predictions are not even close to those in English..
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingtwo,"However, now with Jellybean 4.1.2 when swift key is selected as default keyboard, it takes quite awhile for the keyboard to open up.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"It's would be refreshing to see other keyboard themes.
",info

lenfive,ratingtwo,"When is more themes coming
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"It's been MONTHS since hundreds if not thousands of users faithfully and trustingly waiting for the additional of Chinese language support.

",info
lenten,ratingfour,"The portrait mode doesn't give me a predictions anymore.

leneleven,ratingtwo,"But it makes my browser crash allmost everytime I use it.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"Great except every time the phone turns off it resets to the default Samsung keyboard.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"Any reason why I can't load language packs?
",info
lentwenty,ratingtwo,"Some apps result in SwiftKey replacing the enter key with the smiley key as primary and long press as enter.

lennineteen,ratingtwo,"If there was an option to remove the smiley and leave as enter this wouldn't be an issue.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"1, an option to add/remove words from the dictionary is present. The current method for word learning requires a few uses of the desired word.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"2, a backup feature, so I don't lose my dictionary when I migrate phones.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingtwo,"SwiftKey 3 its crashing in web browser (chrome and stock browser) while selecting search bar and editing txt.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"Although you should make more themes.

lenthirtytwo,ratingfour,"Faroese language is not registered, and I understand why because it is so small, but I wish I somehow could personalize the languages even more.so that it automatickly remebers faroese words

",info
lentwentyone,ratingone,"I just heard all these good things about this app and then right from the start the languages don't download...

",info
lensix,ratingfive,"But there should be more themes
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"PLZ make more themes n can u make the key board look like adapt keyboards plz
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"The keyboard itself is great but the word predictions are atrocious.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingthree,"Why can't it learn directly from all of my typing, instead of having to via gmail, twitter or Facebook - none of which I have.
",info
lenfour,ratingthree,"Please improve the predictions.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"It's alright I guess but it seems to have a knack for freezing up high end devices
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"But keeps failing to download English language pack update so now I have no autocorrect :(
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfour,"I would give it a 5 star as it's perfect but it's annoying that despite being set as my default keyboard I still have to switch to it every time my phone restarts.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingtwo,"I like the speed it allows me to type but the predictions that automatically insert when I don't notice change my word completely.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingtwo,"And the most annoying thing of all that hasn't been fixed yet by any update, is the app some how turns off my haptic feed back.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"There's a bug where the predictive keyboard doesn't always register. You have to come out of the message and go back into it.
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingthree,"The word prediction is spot on, the different themes look great, but the inability to use swype is annoying, as is the inability to use ALT+backspace to delete an entire line of text.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingtwo,"Because if a user inputs a VALID word, the program should NOT auto-replace it with anything else, no matter how much more relevant it thinks that is.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Only thing lacking is the ability for handwriting with note 2 spen.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"I'd like it more context sensitive (eg: email vs sms, my gf vs my boss,  etc), but not sure if android passes that info.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"IT FORCES CLOSE WHEN USING ON CHROME, quite randomly, but too often to be acceptable.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"But has an annoying habit of auto correcting correctly spelt shorter words into inappropriate longer ones.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"this is the best keyboard ever, but it eats quite a lot of memory
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"As I'm typing the cursor jumps to the middle of a sentence.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"It has some great features, but there is a noticeable lag with my GSM Galaxy Nexus.
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingone,"the whole point of the Samsung Galaxy is the swiping, it differs from every other kind of phone, and this app does not support swiping this app sucks,I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!!!!!!!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"5 stars when i can disable prediction in favor of more screen real estate.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"Was working fine until it said that it is unable to load language packs, including English!
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"1. Landscape is always full screen (no option)
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"2. No option to toggle auto-space after punctuation and selecting predicted/corrected word.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"2. Prediction doesn't show up in a lot of cases where it should - should always pop up unless in a username or password dialog.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"4. Speech to text doesn't come up reliably - many times pops up and immediately disappears.
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"5.  Sometimes sluggish to open / type.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"Why there is no Chinese language in this keyboard.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"And also pls have more theme color
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"Would give 5 stars but it keeps defaulting back to the stock keyboard.
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingthree,"I would absolutely love it if you guys could make an update that would allow the user to be able to type in a SWYPE style format instead of having to punch letter after letter.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfour,"Lately there has been issues where the auto correct won't work and sometimes I'll type but nothing pops up, not until I try like 100 times
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfour,"1) SwiftKey should learn from sms, Gmail etc automatically without having to go through settings manually. Before I knew this it annoyed me SwiftKey wasn't learning from my sms.
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfour,"2) when you type a word that's not in the dictionary and SwiftKey changes it to something I don't want, when I backspace I should have my originally typed word as an option.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"I just wish I could download more themes
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"In the configuration screen I set it as my default keyboard but after a while it keeps shifting to another keyboard.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Wish we had a support forum about the product we download.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"Could you add a new theme ""RED NEON"" just like the blue neon (which is great by the way)....
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"Please add emoji there is alot of free keyboards have the emoji symbols :-$
",info
leneight,ratingone,"Phones keeps hanging and crashing after last update
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"very nice keyboard but only thing lacking is choice of themes.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"almost all themes are with closely spaced keys.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"you guys shud add more themes like sony keyboard style or iphone style or stock android jellybean look
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"Loving this keyboard so far, would give it 5 stars except that there is no support for Chinese typing yet.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"Minor niggles are: Please make apostrophes, colons and semi-colons behave like commas and full stops. ie automatic changing of space position.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Apostrophes could be dealt with better too with respect to prompting.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"Only problem I ever had was that it often capitalizes words it shouldn't. Like the dutch word ""door"" or ""dank"".
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"Perhaps implement swipe that works as well as Google's implementation and I'll try it again?
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"My only gripe is that it doesn't have more black themed keyboard for us AMOLED screen users (to save power!).
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"The Neon theme is getting a little old...
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"It crashes every time when I add tags into Tumblr app.
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"I wish it was swype capable
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"Only if there were more options to customize the UI.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"Got no use for smileys, instead I'd like to bind that to open the second page of special characters.
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"Doesn't learn some words despite multiple entries.
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"And now it's failing to show the predictive word bar.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"Works great except several times everyday I have to set it as my default.
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"Got annoyed after they teased us with an upcoming swype like feature and haven't heard anything about it since...
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"Well would be better if it were a bit more customizable where the user can define the words and shortcuts.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"Would give 5 stars if a personal dictionary is added as well as the option to learn from whatsapp.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"Since I updated to 4.2, the keyboard has been way slower.
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"Unable to install after second step.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"Seriously what's with them having access to everything we type???
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"Would love it if it had more symbols though :)
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"Not the first time the bloody thing outdates all language packs with no warning when I have no network access.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"The only thing it's missing is more character options!!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Awesome keyboard but hopefully there will be han yin pinyin support real soon
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingfour,"It's an amazing keyboard except that if you misspell a word and it underlines it, and you select the proper word it doesn't actually change it. It just puts the cursor at that location.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfour,"This is a great app even if now there is the new android 4.2 but to get 5 stars it HAS to have SWIPE like in the new version of android!!!!!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"I only wish there was an option to disable the instant space after a punctuation.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"I constantly hit the space bar after inserting a period which adds a word that I didn't want there.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"On jellybean now on note 2. Really buggy now.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"Very slow to backspace through words and randomly won't display autocorrect suggestions or correct anything.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"Have to close keyboard and reopen to get suggestions way too often.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"Has been brilliant but something has caused the language packs not to download!
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"But on my Thunderbolt multi touch has issues.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"It's a very good application but it support traditional Chinese language will be perfect.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"One thing though, it always corrects ""texting"" to ""testing"" is texting not a word or something?
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"A few more themes would be nice.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"Only thing missing is a clipboard but other than that it fires on all cylinders
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"My only complaint is that every time I restart the phone, it goes back to the default factory Samsung keyboard.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"Everytime I turn my phone off or restart it it goes back to default keyboard and I have to keep activating this one...
",info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"Can't turn off the auto inserted space after a period or question mark. All my messages now have extra spaces after them.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"Love this keyboard, but every time I turn the handset off and on it loses default settings.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"Only one problem is that I don't always get the word select option in some apps such as Firefox.
",info
lenfiftyone,ratingthree,"It's the best keyboard I have used by far, and I love the themes (but maybe a couple more? Or a way to make our own?) but it has issues with certain words like page, which it often automatically capitalizes or it will change ""love"" to ""live"" (or something similar).
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"Edit: Half the time, dragging for punctuation deletes the word I'm typing since JB update.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingthree,"Some of the layout designs annoy me and it takes a long-press to activate voice typing which is frustrating when in a hurry.
",info
lensix,ratingone,"Worked a couple times before crashing.
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"Now can't get beyond choosing English language download due to 'network error', no matter how good my connection is.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"The auto space after a full-stop is ridiculous. Allow the option to turn it off.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"Trying to type a username and the autocorrect changes it.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"Good app but ever since my phone updated to jelly bean today, the keyboard has been a little laggy.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfour,"And the hepatic feedback feels different than it did before. Even at 2ms I can feel it way more than I could before when it was at 7ms, which is inconvenient.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"And what's with not being able to put arrow keys on the tablet version?
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"I'd really like to see a winter/Christmas theme like they havr for Halloween though.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"Also doesnt have a feature to minimize the keyboard. I could not access a certain app one time because of this.
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingone,"so when I am typing a text, the auto correct lags behind then inserts the mistake repeatedly back to back. not only that, but by the time it catches up, it has already sent the message.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"additionally, in the chrome browser the keyboard won't let me type in the appropriate space.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"I find myself constantly switching between LastPass & SwiftKey Keyboards. :-\
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"Although it kinda Sucks how I had to pay for multiple Downloads for each of my devices.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"i like everything about this app with 1 (very significant) exception.no swipe feature.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"i am super-dependent on using swipe to enter words, so without that, there's no real point in me having this app.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingtwo,"It won't autocorrect my misspellings when set to inert a period with double space.
",info
leneighteen,ratingtwo,"when set to insert a prediction, will insert a random word whenever I use punctuation and then space.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"the only problem i have is the themes, needs more.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"The only issue I have is lack of themes.
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Also, no Japanese support!? ...
",info

lentwentysix,ratingfive,"The Samsung stock keyboard on my Galaxy siii is so lame in comparison, it makes me think Samsung is getting a kickback from Swiftkey and Google;)

",non-info
leneight,ratingtwo,"Smooth as butter when is at its best ..
",non-info
leneight,ratingthree,"Very overrated keyboard in general in my opinion.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I was without this for a day or so and was lost...
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Great, one of the best keyboard for Android.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Title basically says it all.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"It would definitely be the first thing to install.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Makes typing ridiculously fast and highly customizable.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfour,"For the keyboard on the next update?
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"It is elegant and works well but I have just bought SlideIT and works better for me
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Amazingly accurate, nimble, impossible to go back to any other keyboard after you get used to this one.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Any I've tried several.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"I got the free trial and after using it for just a few hours I bought the full version.
",non-info
lentwentyseven,ratingfive,"I don't find the keyboard layout all that unique (and the number pad takes some getting used to), but the predictive text is second to none.
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"It makes all of my messages and email so much quicker and I don't think I could go back now!
",non-info
lenthirtyseven,ratingfive,"It's pretty decent straight from the start but the more you use it, the more it learns from you and within a few days I'm typing better than I ever have from a touchscreen device
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Should be on every android device.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"I highly recommend it.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Best app I have bought!
",non-info
leneleven,ratingone,"Who thought this was a great idea to force onto people?
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"What's a wrong swiftkey people.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Great settings!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingone,"Useless on the Galaxy S3
",non-info
leneleven,ratingthree,"I am too use to sliding my finger to type now.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfour,"Perfect keyboard minus a couple things.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"I love it better than the one came with the phone
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Predicts text unbelievably well.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Definitely recommend the download.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfour,"This does save you from many keystrokes.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"However,  the keyboard system that comes with touchwiz sucks pretty bad!!!
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"And when you type a wrong word it fixes to the one that you were looking for!!!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Swift key is awesome.
",non-info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"I'm a fast typist and I miss the mark on most android keyboards but Swift key picks up what I'm typing flawlessly I wouldn't recommend any other keyboard.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"It would let me sent nonsense words I've mistyped, something the iphone auto corrected.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Swift key not only auto corrects but it learns from your typing style.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I love this keyboard its the best 4 dollars I have ever spent.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Very useful and easy to use.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"You can also set it for spell checker but it doesn't automatically insert what IT thinks you mean.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingone,"Love this app but for the moment it's too much work.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"I don't think so.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Otherwise an excellent keyboard with excellent predictive text and excellent spell check.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"Not sure what is causing it but fix that and you will have pure keyboard perfection!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Great keyboard, very accurate!
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"Just try and go back to a default keyboard after using this trial for a month.
",non-info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"got this a while back in the sale for 25p but had then got a iphone , but changed back to android recently , so installed again on my htc desire .
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"i have allowed the app access to Facebook and twitter and also my sms messages to learn my style of writing .
",non-info
lenfive,ratingthree,"It's a normal keyboard.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"would be excellent after that.
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"I have used this app for about one year and it is by far the best keyboard on any smart phone.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"It seriously makes typing sooo much faster and easier.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"It learns from what I type and predicts crazy accurate stuff!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I don't like something change it.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Like eveything else on this phone :)
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Other than that, wouldn't change a thing.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I love it makes my sms much better for things you get lazy about.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Way better than the terrible Samsung Galaxy S3 keyboard.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"It's way faster and a million times more accurate.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Do yourself a favor and download this app.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"The factory keyboard on my galaxy s3 is terrible.
",non-info
leneight,ratingthree,"This app is awesomeness but not without problems.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Learns as you type and makes perfect corrections.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"The best keyboard for fast typers.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"I honestly think this is the best keyboard on android.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingthree,"But not anymore...
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"Decent keyboard but not enough to warrant a purchase over the stock.
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"If this app and thumb keyboard could somehow have a baby app, then that would be the best keyboard ever.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Makes the predictions amd corrections with great ease and accuracy!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfour,"Overall very good.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"That would make it perfect.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I can't believe I was using the standard s3 keyboard for so long!
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"This thing is simply the best touch screen keyboard I've ever used!
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"I wish I would have downloaded it earlier!
",non-info
lentwentyfive,ratingfive,"That said, SwiftKey is an extremely competent app that gets a deserved 5* from me and a huge well done and thanks to the dev team!
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"Going back to the android default made my texting while driving made it 10 times more dangerous than it already is.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Excellent and very useful!
",non-info
leneleven,ratingthree,"I do I need to buy it again for my tablet?
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Between this and swype its even bcuz they both work great and do what their supposed to do.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"It's just great, the looks of keyboards, how it knows what I'm about to type!
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Predictions are changing to your style and tailored to YOU.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfour,"Overall, great keyboard.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"I live this keyboard.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"I have use so many android keyboards and non of them even come close to this one!
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"Other than that,  this is a brilliant app:)
",non-info
lenten,ratingfour,"If that could be fixed i would rate this 5 stars
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingone,"It sucks too that they offer to get the tablet version instead, but of course, you have to pay again...
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"I can't type without this swift :-o
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"This is the BEST keyboard out there.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingone,"Please fix it.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"I would suggest it to anyone.
",non-info
leneight,ratingthree,"I use apostrophes and dot com a lot.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"Ridiculous that assessment, bit cheaper, shot, duck, and see are all changed.
",non-info
lenten,ratingtwo,"It becomes more of a nuisance instead of a features.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"I've been using it for months and I can't imagine going back to anything else.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfour,"Would be 5 star if it was less than a pound
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"Man what a great upgrade to the factory keyboard on the phone.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfour,"I am a want a be texter.
",non-info

lenfour,ratingone,"Have reinstalled several times.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"You new to get this lol wow
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Buy it and never look back.
",non-info
lenten,ratingone,"No reply to my request to have the difference refunded.

lentwelve,ratingfive,"Soo much better than the Android and Samsung keyboard on my phone.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"SwiftKey can finish your words, make predictions and know what you're typing even without hitting the scape bar.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Great Job swift key team kudos to you.!!!
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Truly does what the ad says it do.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Easily the best keyboard app.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I can type on this just as I could type on my blackberry.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Infinitely better than Android's out-of-the-box keyboards.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Very impressive indeed.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfour,"Hopefully it will come in the future.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Very fast and easy.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfour,"It's nice and perfect, but still has 2 problem to choose;
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfour,"If it updated, probably would be the best keyboard for Android.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfour,"Now 4 star.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"Hard to go back to the default keyboard after using this, and finally made me appreciate touch screen typing.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"It's amazing and it will change your life if you text a lot or use twitter frequently.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Without this I can't text for the life of me.
",non-info
lentwentyseven,ratingtwo,"At first I was skeptical even though I'd seen this app on the market for quite some, but I was hooked once I used the trial.

lenten,ratingfive,"I have been using it for a long time now....
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"It's awesome works the best on T-mobile GS2 I can't use any other keyboard now..

lenfive,ratingfive,"I buy this app immediately
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"I tried the trial and this was simply the best keyboard I've ever used.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"In ICS, though, it's very responsive and fast.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I like the way it suggests words when you backspace to change a word.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"I've tried everything out there and nothing comes close in prediction and ease of use.

lenthree,ratingfive,"Just love it

leneighteen,ratingfour,"I don't know if the problem will ever occur again, but for now it has been fixed.

",non-info
lentwentyfive,ratingtwo,"3 weeks without even a response from SwiftKey suggests they may be more interested in their Flow version than making sure the current one works though.

leneight,ratingone,"so I'm not liking it so far.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Makes messaging so much easier
",non-info

lennine,ratingone,"i hate it and I want my money back.
",non-info
lenten,ratingone,"uninstalling and would give it zero stars if i could.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I wish I would've downloaded sooner.
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"I bought this even though my phone came with Swype, because the word predictions are way faster than on Swype.
",non-info
lentwentyseven,ratingfive,"The Swype might seem faster than normal, but text predictions on this App are always better, so I can actually text faster because of it, 2nd to none.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"The android keyboard is nice, however the SwiftKey keyboard is even better!
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"With it's features, I have gotten used to SwiftKey in a day.

",non-info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"To be fair, i've only been using swiftkey for a few days, but it's not for me.
",non-info

",non-info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"It's a good app that does exactly what it says, but it has its downfalls.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"But like I said, I've only been using it for a few days.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"I'll keep using it for a few more and see if it grows on me.

",non-info

",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"... One can purchase for any Android touch screen device, maybe of any touch screen system at all; I can't say.
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"What I can say as an Android touch screen user is that this the best piece of mobile software that I have ever downloaded.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"It has saved me over 60,000 key strokes to date.

",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"I've used this keyboard for years but now android 4.2 features swipe I've stopped using it.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"Too bad, the keyboard itself is very good.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I was uncertain about buying a third party keyboard app like this.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"I mean they all suck, right?
",non-info
lenthirtytwo,ratingfive,"Swiftkey lets me throw my fingers in the key's general direction, and whether or not I hit the right ones it almost always seems to know what I'm looking for.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"Hit more incorrect keys than correct keys, and dont hit spacebar for three words in a row?
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"Yeah, it already knows what you wanted to say  Google needs to make this prediction system standard, it's amazing!

lenthree,ratingfive,"Worth every penny.
",non-info
lenfortysix,ratingfive,"Was happy with ics keyboard up until now, trialed this just for the colours (which are great)  and curiosity, I think it's a much better keyboard by far, and quick to adapt to- 60 seconds later and I paid the $4, I am not going without this.

lennine,ratingfive,"The absolutely best testing app I've ever seen.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"Used to think swipe typing was the fastest but the prediction on this keyboard is a revelation.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Makes one hand or two hand typing really fast.

lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Even Google's new keyboard in 4.2 with real time prediction doesn't match this.

",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"It's just... Perfect
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"Been on SwiftKey for over a year now, it is responsive and the prediction engine is excellent.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I especially love the num pad, much more intuitive than a row of numbers.

",info
lennine,ratingfive,"wish breeding was quicker but looooooooove the app anyways!!!
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"love this game but it lags on my phone
",info
lentwentynine,ratingthree,"like but freezes phone alot new event frozen on training so can't complete a little disappointing, and wish could use coins instead of game dollars to revive fish.
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"it made me continuously click a frog in a bubble, then froze up on me, so i deleted it.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"why is algae reappearing in certain tanks immediately after cleaning....
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"i just wish it was easier to earn fish bucks
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"forcing me to update is pretty rude.....
",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"i was on level 36 and now i update and lose everything all because you decide to force me to update to a flawed version, thank you for ruining this game!!!!!
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"wish there was a faster way though to get more fishbucks.

leneleven,ratingfive,"give more fish bucks and lower prices, but it was awsome
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"it's a great game very relaxing for me an keeps me busy so i never get bored,one thing needs fixin,ukeep same game even if switchin phone.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"i did not receive the two frogs for breeding.

lenten,ratingone,"please give me my  frog so i can breed them.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"wish could get fish bux easier
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"only one thing to make it better, a sign in. so when you get a new phone you don't have to start from scratch.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"wish best decorations were available with coins instead of bucks.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"wish i could earn bucks instead of buying them.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"cost of best fish too high.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"did not get my fishbucks when i download game also played the froggy event and did not get breedable frog to breed
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"would someone like to explain why the frog challenge just ended a day early?
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"wish there were faster growing fish and that there were minigames to play to kill time
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"the only thing i wish is that if you can turn coins into fish bucks.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"like 10,000 coins could get you 2 fish bucks and 20,000 coins could get you 5 or 6.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"should be able to earn cash other ways than ads
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"love this game but is so hard 2 earn fish bucks
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"but maybe have the option of buying fish bucks with the coins, something to get more and faster.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"didn't get my $22 fish bucks for downloading ship wrecked!!
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"this game can be very fun but it takes up so i much of your time taking care of the fish!
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingthree,"if you don't feed them for a day all the fish die, it sucked when i went on vacation and lost all my fish!
",info
lenthree,ratingone,"ripped off    75 bucks...

",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"wish you could earn more fishbucks within the game itself, but overall its cute and easy to play.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"love it just wish there were more breedable fish that didn't cost fish bucks
",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"update update fead up of the game stopping unexpectedly and only option is to force to close y can't there jst b a simple update makes the game work
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"if only it was easier to get fish bucks....
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"great game, just wish it didn't take so long to breed the fish! 3 days is a bit much.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"love it think its cool only complaint is i don't get the free fish bucks from the earn free fish bicks part
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"poor would not connect to the internet: (
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"its plays well but items ony last so long
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"i love the game i just wish it didn't take so long to get money
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"i love this game but i do wish that you could get fish buck way easier
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"love the game,  but it needs to have more fish you can buy with coins and less that you have to use the fishbucks for.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"to complete the game will cost u more than $200.
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingtwo,"so, you aknowledged the fact that the frog challenge had a glitch by changing up the way to purchase the eggs but you won't reimburse the fish bucks lost because of that glitch?
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"the only doubt is u can't get fishbucks 4 fishcash or whatever it is.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"its just i ain't willing to spend money for fish money
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"great ggame but takes too much internet
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"only thing i would change are the notifications.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfour,"would rate it a 5 star but for some odd reason i can't breed any of my mystery fish so it's like if i bought them for nothing!:(
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"also lower the fish prizes a bit please and it will definitely be a 5 star game for me!!!:)
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"pass time favorite ,only dwn side is can't get fish bucks
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"great game can't stop playing, just wish breeding didn't take so long
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingthree,"this app does events all the time that make you accidentally use ""fish bucks"" which are almost impossible to earn and all the coolest stuff you have yo pay for with.
",info
lensix,ratingone,"never got my 100 dollar worth fishbucks
",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"i went to open my game an it says new bee event but nothin is there so u went to see if it needed updated an its up to date.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"plus i lost 20 fish bucks during the frog event & i'm not sure how it happened.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"takes way too long to breed fish though.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"and it is irritating that you don't stay in the shop when buying multiple fish.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"clicked on  bubble and accidentally lossed all fishbucks.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"would like to get the fb back.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingone,"was fun, but, the new bubble is ridiculous, and when i went to.buy one fish, i couldn't make it stop until i had no more bucks.
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"also, alot of the free buck opportunities, do.not give you.the bucks and the fish prices have become outrageous :(
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfour,"i would say the only thing i dont like about it is that its hard to earn fish bucks,and alot of fish you have to buy with the fish bucks....
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"so i would rate this app as perfect if you were able to get free fish bucks and or earn them easier...
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"and twice since the update all of my fish bucks have disappeared.
",info
lensix,ratingone,"i want my 20 fish bucks back
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"love this gane but would be great if the fish grew faster
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"wish there was a better to get fish bucks
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"its fun and is like having real fish could do with some different plants and decorations to be added on though.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"needs more ""free cash & coins"", but over all very cool game.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"i like the app but it wont let me buy fish so there is point keeping the app.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"would like more coin fish less $ fish and the tasks given to be for coin fish not $ fish
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"the fish that i'm breeding for the current event are disappearing when i move them into the tank.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"i would really like if i could move to another device it seems to be taking a lot of space!
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"just wish you could earn fish bucks faster lol
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"i did not receive the two frogs for breeding.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"please give me my  frog so i can breed them.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"great only thing that sucks is fish buck free offers. when ya try putting in numbers it kicks you out of the offers.
",info
lenfive,ratingfive,"easier way to get bucks
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"force closes alot but still love it.....
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"great time waster but to many fish for fish bucks i mean i have no money for fish bucks there needs to be less fish for fish bucks.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"pretty easy to use and hamless unless you get greedy to have mmore coins or money.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"good game but need ways to earn more fishbucks
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingtwo,"i do like this game but i want to be able to earn fish bucks.because all the fish i like are are fish bucks for example phrina is 20 fish bucks ani only have 2.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"love this wish there want so many things to buy with bucks.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"love this game wish there was better ways to earn fish bucks though
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"great game but would be better if didn't force close so much
",info
lenthirtyeight,ratingfive,"the game is great the only problem is that my memory on my phone fills up to fast and the weather makes it lage a little but been a loyal fan and player for a year or so.
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"drains battery on galaxy s2 epic 4g.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"sold fish bred during breeding even but game cheated me out of 6k+ coins.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"wish you could earn/find more fishbucks.....
",info
lenthirty,ratingtwo,"but not anymore can't breed the fish that i want too buy fish to breed and won't let me do it what is the point of this game...
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"great but cost too much fish bucks to play
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"cons - sometimes gliches -waaaaay too hard to get fish bucks
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"love the game feel that there needs to be more breedable fish and more ways to earn fish bucks
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"would like to see more scale.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"please fix it keeps sayin unable to conecte when i go to by fish but its a 5 star i love this game
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"good game but it just wants you to spend money :/
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"its cute but too many things cost a lot of fish bucks and its hard to get them....
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"bucks no so fun.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"game is ok and the timing is not fun either but fool fishes
",info
lennine,ratingone,"every time i try to play it force closes.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"have lost fish bucks for no reason...
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"wish there were a way to trade or get fish from friends!
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"tack to long to load but good game
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"fish bucks too expensive
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"its fun, but fishbucks and coins are way too hard to get.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"you also should be able to do more things with your fish.
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingfour,"bee playing this game since two years ago wheni first started with my iphone ; tthe only complain is i cant carry forward all my points and levels after i switched to note 2!
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"since last update i do not have some fish.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"getting free fish bucks is getting harder & harder & has not been updated in a mo. customer service is great and this fish game is way better then others.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"there is another glitch w/ feeding friends  takes up alot of space i have to uninstall & re install & restore alot!
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"definitely need more coin fish...
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"is there anyway to get your game back if you switch phones??
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"too much stuff is bought with fish bucks.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"also it freezes a lot
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"wish you could get more coins, bucks, and spins faster.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"a moderately entertaining game but still requiring real money for fake fishbucks to do much of anything.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"i wish all the good fish wasn't so high
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"great but cost too much fish bucks to play
",info
lentwelve,ratingtwo,"the cost to play is too high and the software is buggy.
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"cost of fish bucks is unreasonable as well.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"fun game, i love the variety of fish and decorations but it's so easy for your fish to die!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"i enjoy playing tap fish except for how hard it is to get fish bucks.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"just would like to get more bucks for doing things
",info
lenfortysix,ratingfour,"i like  it but they dont give enough money or coinsand if u dont login everyday your fish die, i have a job soi cant play games everyday so they should have babysitter fish to buy for like 20 coins who freeze tank for your vacation needs
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"but some of the items an fish cost to much real money.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"a little cluttered and slow..
",info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"only wish there was a way to retrieve deleted tanks and transfer tanks from one phone to another.
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"its a little slow starting out.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"coins are super tight but the games pretty fun
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"need more ways to get fish bucks!
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"great game, but i wish there was a way to earn more fish bucks especially since the tasks make you spend a ton at once.
",info

",info
leneight,ratingthree,"i love it just want more bucks rewards

lenfour,ratingfive,"why is tapfish disabled
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"forse closes allot when using certain feat.
",info

",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"deffenetly 4 stars only 4 because a little hard when ur not able to play for a while
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"i'd like to see more purchases available for coins, rather than cash.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"i liked the game,but i needed to update my phone and application did not open,sad,had to uninstall,there were no instructions how to trouble shoot.
",info
lenfive,ratingfive,"great game but too slow
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"only problem is getting fish bucks to buy everything
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"love the game but sometime freezes
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"why can't we exchange coins in for fish bucks?
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"would have gotten 5 stars if i could of kept the game when i changed phones.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"becomes addicting and sometimes it had to froce close
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"this game is really fun i like it exept everything cost too much
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"i just wish it would quit shutting dowm for no reason.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"if u guys can fix that and stop wantimg so many fishbucks for things
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"very fun good way to pass time could fix lag though
",info

",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"the frog event sucks cocks every time i pop a bubble all of them fail wat the fuk !
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"won't even let me download it but rated it any way:-)
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfive,"love this game only thing i'm mad about is i got a new phone and lost all my fish and could not get anything back :-(
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"this game is actually really fun, i wish you could get fish bucks easier though.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"i can't give it 5 stars though because it freezes up.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"some easier way of earing bucks would be better as there are challenges that you can't meet without them.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"with the recent android update, tapfish has gotten soooo slow!
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"i wish there were more challanges at a time.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"and not so many requiring fish bucks to buy things.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"just doesn't make sense to pay for fake money!
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingtwo,"also, there are too few options for those of us who can't/won't spend tons of money on fish bucks.
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"aren't you making enough money through ads?
",info
lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"do you really want to continue trying to bore us into buying fish bucks?
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"im not a fan of how the majority of fish and ornaments require ""fish bucks""
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"it kills time but there needs to be a way to ""pause""
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingone,"i downloaded shipwrecked and its been 2 days since i downloaded it and no free fish bucks are appearing in my fish bucks spot that's 22 fish bucks you owe me give them in 2days or i uninstall
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"accidently uninstalled reinstalled and restarted my sis went on and added me and it came up with my old 1 and all the fish dead but otherwise its great
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"game should save itself to my play account.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"only wish you could change coins for bucks....
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"i updated tapfish because my phone said i had to, and the game had totally changed..
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"it made me continuously click a frog in a bubble..
",info
lennine,ratingtwo,"then froze up on me, so i deleted it.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"like the game, but i wish you could earn more fish bucks faster.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"i love it and so does my daughter just want more easier ways for fish bucks.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"great game but hard to get fishbucks which u need to get stuff in game
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"takes a lot of time to level up and speed ups cost bucks.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"i love playing this game i just wished i could gain levels much faster amiga...
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"love the game just take to long to generate cash and bucks
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"way too slow for my phone.
",info

",info
lenten,ratingfour,"only one thing to make it better, a sign in.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"so when you get a new phone you don't have to start from scratch.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"now ive lot all my prizes  that's again tap fish, you're getting deleted finally
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"it sucked when i went on vacation and lost all my fish!
",info
lenthree,ratingone,"ripped off 75 bucks...
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingtwo,"so, you aknowledged the fact that the frog challenge had a glitch by changing up the way to purchase the eggs but you won't reimburse the fish bucks lost because of that glitch?
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"it takes a while to load at first but its worth it!
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"it's fun but there isn't much to do after you clean the tank, feed and love the fish.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"the bucks are impossible to earn, not enough instructions and to much waiting around for breeding to happen.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"pretty cool but everything is expensive
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"i love it and so does my daughter just want more easier ways for fish bucks.
",info
lenfiftytwo,ratingfive,"i just wanna say that i love tapfish i just have one suggestion can u guys plz come up with some kind of password so that when friends who dont know what their doing grab ur phone and start messing with stuff dont sell all ur fish and mess up ur tanks.
",info
lenfortynine,ratingthree,"i think there should be a way to level up faster because it takes forever trying to level up, and maybe there should also be a breedable catagory for lazy people (such as i) that way we dont have to spwnd a half hour trying to find breedable fish
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"really good game only bad thing is tht most of the tsks u have to have fish bucks apart from that it is good
",info
lenthree,ratingfive,"do more batfish
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingtwo,"can't breed new fish often cause i can't get more than 2 tanks to bread, then it takes on average 3 days to breed one fish lol.
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfour,"however i wish a lot of the fish did not cost as much fish bucks as they do. its hard 2 earn enough of them in order 2 complete the tasks & it's expensive 2 buy them.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"plus it is hard to get fish bucks.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"love this game but i agree there should be a way to level up faster
",info
lentwelve,ratingtwo,"could be a good game but is very slow & demanding of time
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"cute game but have to play it every day or fish will die of starvation
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"just wish it didn't take as long as it does to breed fish.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"i don't realy like the pictures and how it's so flat and boring, but i like the huge the selection of fish.
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingfive,"the game is pretty fun jusr wish that the fish bucks were easier to get and everything was cheaper but overall p0retty fun i would recomend it also wish the fish didn't die so fast
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"fun game but super hard to earn fishbucks
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"enjoyable game,,,slow to start though.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"wish the tutorial was a little slower.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"just wish it was easier to get fish bucks w/o having to buy them or download so many other apps.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"love the game but not 5 stars because the fish die way to fast
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"love this game but i wish you could get more fish bucks for free.
",info
leneighteen,ratingtwo,"boring and stupid because you need lots of money to buy things and they barely give u any
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"it's fun just long and alot of things you need fish bucks for but you barely get them for free
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"for 2 days and now it won't open any more
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfive,"i wish i never updated my tap fish game i used to be able to buy puffer fish that would bring in the $$ but not any more.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"i just wish it was easier to earn fish bucks to get all of the crazy fishies!
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"only complaint it takes a few seconds to load.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingtwo,"i love to play, but you need to spend lots of money to get fish to breed.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"needs more fish and new fish.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"could go a bit faster though
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"you can't do much without fish bucks and they cost $.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"game shuts down alot but other than that its great.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"stupid game give my more fish bucks
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"hard to obtain fish bucks.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"great game, but needs more fish for higher levels.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"i'm level 54 and there is nothing for several more levels.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"like alot, love fish, dont like 2 spend real money or have 2 download stuff u dont want just 2 get more bucks or coins.
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"needs fake money 2 spend.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"takes to long to level up and most quests take $ to complete!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"it doesn't give u hardly any coins for tending to ur fish!
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"however, it takes way too long to earn bucks.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"the challenges are fun at first but then it gets old.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"it constantly asks to buy more bucks.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"there should be an option to exchange coins for bucks.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"4/5 hard go get fish bucks but fun
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"there should be an easier way to get bucks. how 'bout every 500 coins you get you get one?
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"that way people can revive their fish without having to pay as often.
",info
lenforty,ratingfour,"i got a new phone and    now i cannot get back into the game that i have   spent so much money on i have been well over $1000.00 and it's a shame to lose everything that i just built up.
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"i paid money to remove ads and i still got them
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"but should have a way of buying fish bucks using your coins.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"wish the tutorial was a little slower.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"very good game, some lagging but that might just be my phone.
",info
lenfive,ratingfive,"a little cluttered and slow.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"also alot of focus on fish bucks, which are hard to get without buying them.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"i wish there was more way to earn fish bucks.
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"this last update stole millions of coins from my tank not to mention all the bs with the frog event.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"the only downfall is hard to get fish bucks without buying them.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"maybe trading coins for bucks or awarding more bucks when leveling up.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"would rate higher but to obtain breeder fish and other things you need to pay2play and i just can't offord it.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"dislike bubble tips and smiley faces on feed fish.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"it is very fun but make it a little more interactive with the fish
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"i wish they could put in a permanet mini game to get fish bucks,coins,fish or decorations ethre
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"its a cool game but its stupid you can progress if u don't have bucks wilhich u need credit card for
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"it'll glitch everytime i go to play store then exit it and click the game itself on the phone it just goes right back to play store
",info
lenthirtynine,ratingfive,"not giving all fishbucks when you download games also when foggy event was over did not receive breedable frog did not get my fishbucks when i download game also played the froggy event and did not get breedable froggy
",info
lenthirtyseven,ratingfour,"it does take an awfully long time to level up,  and it's unfortunate that so many basic things can only be bought with ""fish bucks"" which are very difficult to earn many of without paying money.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"and many quests require you to buy these things.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"i just wish you could advance up quicker yeah you can speed up your fish eggs to hatch.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"i can't give it 5 stars though because it freezes up.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingtwo,"it won't let me connect to the server. i report it every time but it is always the same thing.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"won't let me participate in the easter event.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"every time i catch the fish, it says ""image not found""
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"i love it (but why will they make the decoration's and every thing so much you can just get a fish with that money and fish buck's
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"i 'v played this app before it crashs alot but i'm giving it a second chance if it did not crash i would have this app forevef
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"its fun except every thing needs fishbucks
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"love this game but very disappointed with the adds that pop up!
",info
lensix,ratingone,"you should monitor what's advertised.
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"hate waiting but great
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"takes a while to load but it already filled the last two hours of fun
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"it would be better if the game will allow me and my phone not to be on the internet all the time and still be this fun & cool!
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"good but the good fish cost fish bucks which you have to buy with real money and the fish are way to expensive.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"it also take way to long to level up.
",info
lenseven,ratingtwo,"can't breed the fish i want.
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"fish bucks are too much!
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"thank you tap fish makers but please have more games to earn fish bucks !
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"wish it didn't take so long to breed special event fish.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfour,"after the update the bubble icon is taking a lot of time this game is entertaining but it must be fast so to be fast please remove bubble icon
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"i also love the breeding just wish it didnt take  do long to breed!
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfour,"the only thing i don't like is that if you miss the deadline on an event cuz of work or anything there is no extension.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"changed phones and lost everything which stinks.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"i'd like to see more purchases available for coins, rather than cash.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"only wish fish bucks were easier to come by
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"there needs to be a way to transfer my game to another phone.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"spenf a lot if time and money on this then got a new phone and am having to start over!
",info
lenforty,ratingone,"ive switched phones, downloaded tap fish and i have to start all over again i believe i had pleanty more fish than the 2 i have now and my fish bucks are gone how do i get my fish tanks back.?
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"or be able to buy more with coins.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"all the fish's eggs should be displayed under one head, instead of various categories and also the selling star rating should be displayed
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"takes too long to move up levels though
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"great app try to purchase fish bucks though other apps but, still waiting the only bad thing
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"but i do think a 12 hr breeding time for a total of 90 fish to breed is a bit long for shorter event time.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"im in love with this game, but fish bucks need to go i hate that.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"live wallpaper needs to be fixed also : (
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingthree,"the new event is not giving me the prize when i bred my fish and 11 hours thats a little to long to be able to get everything.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"cool but one thing to say is that i wish u could earn fish bucks not buy fish bucks
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"changed from 5 stars because the new valentines event takes 12hrs to breed and 6 days to complete.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingtwo,"this game is so  fun except tht the baby fish take for ever to grow
",info
lentwentysix,ratingthree,"i like the game save ur bucks their hard to come by seem like they want u 2 use cash to advance other than that good game
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"i like the events, but sometimes it kind of stinks when you don't have the fish bucks for them.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"and you really don't have good deals for fish bucks.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"love this game, but i wish there was an easier way to transfer game from one phone to the next.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"never succewd open even the internet connection available and in a hi speed wifi.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"this game takes up the most space on my phone.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"but the fonts in the menu are so small! especially inside the events icon.
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"the graphics and fonts overlap!
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"but wish the fish weren't so expensive or cost so many fish bucks
",info
lenninetyfive,ratingfive,"i love playing tapfish and wanna thank u for retrieving the coins i couldn't get but i really wish i wouldn't of lost all my tanks and all the work i had in this game for the past yr i lost a lot of tanks and fish that took days to earn and the money spent while i played .but i had to get a replacement phone ,same phone just wish i wouldst of lost all that i worked hard for should be a way to not loose games that would b awesome !
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"i want alot of fish bucks for free please
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"game not bad, but you start off slow.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"wish there was an easier way to get coins and cash.
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"joys of fun only downfalls is it takes forever to level up and fish cost way to much fish bucks.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"not easy trying to earn fish bucks without actually spending real money.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"could use some form of sorting option but sure is addicting
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"it is very show moving store to i don't want to spend real money to get fish bucks.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"it takes a long time to accumulate bucks to buy things or to speed up the breeding process.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"i just wished that i could earn fish bucks faster
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"need more fish bucks free!
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"a cool app just takes to long and  not  lot to do n between everything is a litle pricey too!
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"good game but constantly crashes.!
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"cool just wish you got fish bucks often
",info
lenseven,ratingtwo,"i still can't breed mystery fish.
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingfive,"ilove this game and so does my 3 yr old grandson he always asks gamma can i play fish with you only problem is when i changed phones i lost it all but it is fun rebuilding
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"some of the valentine species are a bit odd though!
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"should get more free fish bucks though
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"very addicting and time comsuming but it could use more ways to earn fish bucks.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"my only complaints are that we should be able to still get our prizes from events even after the event is over.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"the other thing is that you should have like bubbles or something pop up so we can earn xp, fb or coins.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingtwo,"the valentine game is way too long,12 hours to breed, so no way to get half way through ribbing three breeding tanks.
",info
lenfour,ratingtwo,"note the disappearing bucks.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"the fish bucks are too hard to get.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"its fun with all the cute fish but i wish there were more events because they are fun
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"during updates & events, i was losing my daily prizes & my free spin on the 5th day.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"i love it just want more bucks rewards
",info
lenfiftytwo,ratingfive,"it's a really addictive game i love it but it keeps crashing my phone it always tells me to force close some of the breedable fish are to expensive and it's hard to get fish bucks without having to buy them with ur own cash ain't doing it uninstalled! !
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"just wish it was easier to get fish bucks and more breedables for coins
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"if you could buy more fish bucks using just fish coins thatd be awesome.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"fun game don't like the fact that you have use real money to buy fishbuck
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"slow to load but addictive
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"good but taking days to grow fish
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"or be able to buy more with coins.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"umm its trying to make me use my brothers acount to buy fish bucks ither than that good
",info
lennine,ratingone,"doesn't save and won't let me uninstall
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"wish it was free instead of pay credit card.lame.don't download this game at all.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"populate tanks as you wish for fun or to unlock new fish & decorations.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"great spp wish there were more ways to ean fish bucks tho.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"and wish there were more themed fish and backgrounds for the hoildays other thrn that great app
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"decent game,tough to earn fishbucks
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"love it but somtices it forcefully close
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"wish it didn't take forever to level up though.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"would give 5 stars but its slow loading different things.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"the only issue i have with this game is that it can be quite expensive!
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"it takes forever to earn ""fish bucks"" and almost everything requires you to use them for purchases, speed ups, most decorations, etc.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"so real but hard to get fish bucks!
",info
lenthirtyseven,ratingone,"to pass a quest you need to buy a fish that cost 49 fishbucks and at the end you could sell it but its only worth some coins i thinking in removing game i dont recommend this game.
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingfive,"been playing for like a year now the only thing that bothers me is the fish bucks it should be easier to get them and less fish bucks for fish and items!
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"i gave it a five but i think events should last a little longer so that you get a chance to comlete them.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"one other thing is some items shouldn't cost so much and you should have more chances to earn fishbucks.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"great game, but i wish there was a way to earn more fish bucks especially since the tasks make you spend a ton at once.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"too hard to earn fish bucks/dollars and too many $$ only items.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"reasonable price for extra coins and $$ but should be able to do all things without sending $$ with ads displayed.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"you gotta have fish bucks for a lot of things.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"you can only get fish bucks by buying it or clicking their ads.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"i can't open tapfish since update.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"i love the game but wish it was easier to get fish bucks and quicker
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"i love this app at times it can run slow not sure if that is cuz my phone or connection speed but it doesn't make to much of a difference.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"just wish once you wished a certain level you could buy mystery breedables with coins and not just fish bucks
",info
lenthree,ratingtwo,"stores stuff needlessly.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"have to clear data and restore game periodically in order to free up memory.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"restore sometimes installs data that is 5+ days out of date, so progress is lost.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"i think it would be nice to earn fish bucks in other ways.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"may be you could buy fish bucks with your coins, charge us a sum of coins you couldbuy fish bucks.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"but the fonts in the menu are so small! especially inside the events icon.
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"the graphics and fonts overlap!
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"fish bucks need to be easier to receive though.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"cool but one thing to say is that i wish u could earn fish bucks not buy fish bucks
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"the only thing preventing the fifth star is that some people are able to 'cheat' by rooting their phones and giving themselves unlimited bucks.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"like very much but wish fish bucks were easier to get.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"could use some form of sorting option but sure is addicting
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"it lags a bit and takes awhile to level up, but it's still entertaining.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"just if it were easier to get bucks, i would have gave it 5 stars.
",info
lentwenty,ratingtwo,"a cool app just takes to long and  not  lot to do n between everything is a litle pricey too!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingtwo,"need 2 come way down on all prices & giv out a lot mor gold & fish bucks!
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"i love it but the new quest game is so dumb why the f$!k cant u earn fishbucks instead of coins i have over 4million coins i need bucks.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"i had to restart due to accidental tank deleting.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"we should have our stuff returned not deleted!
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"where are my fish bucks  i did what they told me but disnt received fish buckz
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"addictive, still a little glitchy and epensive
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"but memory it takes up is a joke.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"just wish u didn't have to buy fish bums for a lot of ur tasks.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"i love the game i just wish there was a easier way to get fish bucks.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"i am getting a new phone and i hope i will be able to keep my tap fish progress.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"is there anything that i can do to transfer my progress to my new phone?
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"i do not want to loose my fish, 300,000 + coins and my earned bucks.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"between forced closes, freezing, & constant charging fishbucks for most items required for quests, i'm just done.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"i just wish it wasn't so hard to get extra fish bucks without having to buy them.
",info
lentwenty,ratingtwo,"a good fun game but the free stuff gets boring very fast and requires real money to buy more stuff
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"it's need to help make money faster
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"wud like easier ways 2 earn fish bucks
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"this is a goid game but i wish you didnt have to buy the fish bucks.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"so far tapfish is going good i just dont like it when you have to wait for the fish bucks
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"would be 5 but u need cash for almost everything.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"got up to level 60 and lost all my progress.
",info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"it takes forever to level up and get enough coins to buy the stuff you want for your tanks.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"just wish it were easier to earn fish bucks.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"great game but if level up is going to be so slow fish bucks should be easier to earn or buy.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"for some reason i can't even purchase fish bucks (error).
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"force closes alot but still love it.....
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"love this game, would rate higher but after about 3 weeks it now is telling me that i have to connect to the internet.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"lower the prices on things have an income of money if done 5 stars
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"not a bad game, but annoyingly slow
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"its totally fun and addicting but you run out of fish bucks and  coins to easily
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"fun needs more ways to win prizes.
",info
lentwo,ratingfive,"cheaper fish
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfour,"this game had great graphics and a wide variety of different fish, but you needed a lot of ""fish bucks"" to buy most of the ones you need for your achievements.
",info
lenfortyfive,ratingfour,"i am addicted to playing it but i wish you could earn more fish bucks more easily cause i am now stuck and can't complete any task without any fish bucks and can't get any fish bucks cause i can't complete tasks
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"just wish the really cool fish and accessories weren't quite so expensive.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"would be nice if it was easier to get fish bucks.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"it can be fun but using the new version and it still loses your money.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"this app stole  75 bucks beware of this app,  it locks up,  and or is  glitchy the (game) will stell your hard earned money from you.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingone,"go ahead and buy fish bucks, or download the apps they want you to try to earn bucks, and have a fish burp good bye fish bucks.
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"and refuse to replace missing buck's.
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"i love this app at times it can run slow not sure if that is cuz my phone or connection speed but it doesn't make to much of a difference.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"would be 5 stars if adverts did'nt keep on popping up and the coins and fish bucks were all free
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"new year event start on ios devices but not on android devices?
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"we just hate waiting on breed process ;)
",info
lenthirtynine,ratingfour,"pretty fun to play for awhile but tedious must keep up with it on a daily basis in order to receive full benefit will need to purchase fish bucks so if your cheap this isn't game for you
",info
lenseventyseven,ratingfive,"but sucks because it says you can earn fishbucks by downloading apps and doing other things when it doesn't its such a joke you can't get anywhere in this game without the fishbucks, and if it freezes my phone up again, im done with it, ive had to start over several times in this game, have, thought bout buying fishbucks but i will be damned if i pay for something that will just be lost!
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"the game is great except i got a new phone and couldn't transfer it over so i had to start over.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"also it keeps stopping and closing for no reason.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"should be able to earn cash other ways than ads
",info
lenfortyone,ratingthree,"i found a better fish game with cuter fish i got tired of this game force closing and i cant seem to make enough fish bucks to keep my fish alive i got really bored but it was fun for awhile
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"love it just try giving more free fish bucks as prizes.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"have yet to have a force close.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"well, its good but it takes too long to breed and u can only do one at a time
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"but it's getting very frustrating with it closing down constantly.
",info
lenforty,ratingthree,"i have a suggestion also for breeding is it possible to do the same on both sets of breeding where if there's only certain fish that can breed together that all the others disappear like the mystery tanks do??
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingthree,"it's gotten better not sure if it's from upgrades you've done or that i've upgraded my phone which by the way for some reason could not get my old game
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"just wish i started off with more fishbucks
",info
lenforty,ratingfive,"in the last few days though i've noticed that the fish aren't swimming smoothly like they usually do, don't know if it needs an update i've tried logging out and in but its still doing it.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"i love it but i wish the fish didn't take so long to grow up
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"just wish you didn't have wait so long for the fish to breed.
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"why is tapfish disabled
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"this game could have better information,help,better upgrade on this tapfish game,better news,no pay credit is lousy.
",info
lennine,ratingone,":-( after the latest android update.my 70 tanks are gone.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"it only lets me breed 2 fish in the mystery breeds.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"which either takes forever to earn, costs actual money, or you have to take surveys and download/play other apps to get.
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"otherwise i like it.
",non-info

lenfour,ratingfour,"i love this game!
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"it's fun, and challenging when you're trying to level and complete quests.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfour,"very addicting!
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"the only thing i frown on is the most stuff cost fish bucks.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingtwo,"when ever i try to breed, the fish are there but whenever i tap on them it only gives me one to breed when there are several there.
",info
lennine,ratingtwo,"i can't visit any of my neighbor tanks....
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"i think you shuld make a place where you can change fish mony into fish buks and fish buks into fish mony.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"then after that update it wunt let me play the missions.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingtwo,"after this last event i can't breed and i lost a lot of fish.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"after this latest update three tanks of fish are missing an i can no longer breed fish.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingone,"when i went to play and i had my breeding tank  ready to put the fish in tank they was gone .
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"just wish events were easier to make your goals.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"some of the fish too expensive to buy but overly i adore this game.
",info
lenfortynine,ratingfour,"or such things it does make things go by a little bit faster breeding does take a little too long i think right now i'm waiting 2 days that's a bit long and i'm not spending money sorry i have a baby that needs my money first.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"wish fish bucks were easier to get.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"i had one issue where i had to delete my second tank but other than that its been awesome
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"its not excellent because its hard to get money and still have fish.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"epic game ever but give ways to get more fish bucks easier :)
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"also, make prices lower
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingfour,"love it wish the tanks were a little cheaper and wish they would have more ways to earn fish bucks instead of having to pay once they do that it will be a 5 star app
",info
lennine,ratingone,"it takes forever to level up on this game.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"i play on my ipod and would really like to be able to transfer my game to my android.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"but why is it so slow and small on my motorola atrix..
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"i purchased 2 20 fish bucks packages in the last couple weeks and neither showed up.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"was fun, but, the new bubble is ridiculous, and when i went to.buy one fish, i couldn't make it stop until i had no more bucks.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"i just wish it didn't freeze so much and there was an easier way to get coins
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"beginner game started up & will not restore.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"i have did the earn free bucks and have not received any thing
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"per tapfish ""somehow my tapfish went corrupt & start the game over"".
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"apart from it popping up telling me to leave 5*s all the time its a good game, wish there was more things to do without paying real money though..
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfive,"it could be little better if there is a way to cash in coins for bucks  or at least easy way to get free bucks ...
",info
lenfiftyone,ratingfive,"okay here's another idea space theme astronaut fish and it makes aliens a spaceship decoration and planets and space backgrounds and space decorations and meteor shower that moves and a moon that turns or the earth mini solar system for a reward and rockets and moon rovers and flying saucers.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"there should be more events once one is over.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"good game but it can be slow at progressing
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"i lost everything that i spent over a year doing.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"its a brilliant game until it starts freezing and forcing close but the kids do love it.
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"i luv this game but it takes days to hatch most eggs and u have to spend money to complete tasks, but it is a free game, ppl have 2 make money!
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingthree,"it would be nice if we could purchase more than one item at a time, rather than going back and forth for same item.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"it never fetches data from server cant able to play it till now...:(
",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"i really like the game but am disapointed that most of the objects you need or want to buy must be bought with fish bucks other than that grea game
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"wish there were more fish bucks rewards though.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"good game overall but eats memory so far
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"good game but crashes alot
",info
lenthirtyeight,ratingfour,"breeding takes to long and more breeding tanks cost too much but this is a great game i'm 35 and all my kids love it from 5 ye old to 7, 11,and 15 ye old ty for a fun addictive game!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"can't play for more than a few minutes before it force closes.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"per tapfish ""somehow my tapfish went corrupt & start the game over"".
",info
leneight,ratingone,"always hangs and consumes a lot of memory..
",info
lentwo,ratingfive,"add tadpoles!! :)
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"i have more then ten of all 4 frog breads why cant i claim the 7th collection item?
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingthree,"i have 2 limited breedable fish and when i try to breed them it is saying i don't have any limited breedable fish somebody please fix this so that i can breed my fish?
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"but for the last week every time i turn on the app, it freezes my touch screen up.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingtwo,"and all of the other fish cost fish bucks while its already so hard to get coins!
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"need 2 be able 2 get more things  easier like fish bucks...
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"uninstalled kept force closing on me and i lost everything..
",info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"i've played this on 2 phones now and i wish my old fish had followed from apple to android...
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingthree,"rebuilding my collection of fish is gonna be expensive,  wish it was possible to buy buck fish for higher coin prices or earn bucks easier.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"bubble tips get on my nerves ...
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"pop up to many times.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingone,"aware but no help - the bubble-pop event ended two months ago & i have 24 half-evolved fish-bubbles flashing-red & i can't pop, sell, kill or delete them.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"this game suckes don't install its a rip off this company just wants your money
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"can there be a way to trade coins for bucks please!
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"fish bucks are to hard to get and to buy the good breedable fish you have to use alot of your hard earned fish bucks
",info
lenfortytwo,ratingthree,"i was on level 12, then had to reset my phone to get a new phone, switched out my sd card, memory card, and battery (yes i saved data before removal) placed everything in my new phone, and it started from the beginning.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"having the same problem as everyone else, can't even access game now.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"it's a bit slow sometimes on my metropcs optimus m, but could be my phone's fault.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"works great on my tablet, my only issues with this game is the difficulty to earn coins and fish bucks.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"we should be able to skip those even if we had to spend some coinage to do so.
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"i have gotten a data parsing error for the second time.
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"runs a little slow sometimes.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingthree,"actually five times to be exact when the submarine was filled to the max n several other times when i only had a few items.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"dont last long bucuz everything is so high to buy with fish bucks!!
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"breeding time should be shortened too.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"fun but shuts down frequently
",info
lenfortyeight,ratingfive,"would be five stars but the fish inch across the screen and it lags when i try to bring up a menu or anything but when i have a menu brought up the fish swim smoothly instead of inching but if the lag was fixed it would be 5stars!!!
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"just started getting error messages.
",info
lenseven,ratingtwo,"the game constantly freezes and force closes.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"and it would be nice if i could chat with a friend who is using an i phone.
",info
lenthree,ratingfive,"lower prices please
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"but when i had to change phones i lost everything and couldn't remember my account cause i had it for so long.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"well only one problem and its to hard to earn fish bucks ples fix it i love the game so i will give 5 stars
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingthree,"i love tha game but it started me all over twice & gave me fish bucks like that part but starting all over again i don't like
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"lots of fun to play but does crash sometimes on my droid 2
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"would like to be able to earn  more fish bucks!
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"you get 1300 fish bucks for $100.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"love the game, just wish you got more bucks to buy the more exotic fish as you are very ltd with coins
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"wish it was cheaper and faster the backgrounds are too expensive!
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"would giv mre stars bt is always shutn phne dwn bc of phne temp gts 2 hot!
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"this is a great game but certain functions like cleaning the tank don't work well on a phone...
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"with a few adjustments like making it easier to get cash and coins as well as the cleaning problem this would be an amazing game
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"the only downside is that more than half the fish are only available thru in-game purchase of fishbucks.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"the fish cost to much and they made up half the fishes names
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"i love the breeding events the best though, don't really like the submarine ones :/
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"its upsetting thoughwhen u get a new phone, there is no way to transfer the game.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"also hard to earn fish bucks.
",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"why does it stop working for no reason, on my motorola droid razr maxx, and now it wont connect me into the game, fix please, i love my fish game!!
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfive,"still on daily bonus all i get is coins needs 2 b more fish bucks added and/or fish coins aren't doin me any good right now.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingtwo,"get ffree fish with purchase of tank bucks is quite unfair to those of us who cant afford to spend $$ when new fish are avail for breeding.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"it would be a welcomed improvement to have the occasional reward of a fish buck or two.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"maybe its my phone bt the fish bucks needs more fixing.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"then into the last 2 days my pearls were stolen or it would say i had two clams and then only let me buy 1.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"this is a five star game as long as the parsing error is really fixed.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"needs 2 have easier ways 2 get fishbucks.
",info
lenthree,ratingfive,"keeps force closing
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"bucks that it should be easier to win them in the events play.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"but needs to have a way to earn more fish bucks instead of buying them...
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"too limited options on pairing fish bought with fish bucks and coins.
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingfive,"this game is awesome only problem u have to pay 4 fish bucks i haven't used all mine yet but i am really low on them otherwise this game is great any1 who puts 1 star is crazy
",info
lenthree,ratingfour,"progress is slow.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"gr8 app passes some time away but i dnt like every time i open the app i get a pop up
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfour,"it is slower and the fish and decorations are smaller but tapfish keeps improving it so hopefully soon it is just as good as the iphone version.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"last quest had a ridiculous amount of monsters
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"crashes a lot but still worth it
",info
lenfortyone,ratingfour,"this game for me right now is a four star game, but if they lower the fish prices and if sometimes they would also give you fish bucks when you sell a fish, it will totally be a five start game!!:)
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingthree,"this sucks cause im at a low level and need to breed the neon tetra but can't get it cause it wont level up.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"was working now the server wont connect and if it does it takes 5 mins to do so..
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingthree,"i have also lost lots of my fish bucks to revive my fish becos wen it force close i forget and where i left off, i come back, all my fish are dead.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"what happens to our app when one changes her phone, ie to another andriod?
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"i worked so hard to level up and get my tanks only to get on this afternoon to find that everything reset.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"would be nice to get more breedable fish without having to pay real cash for em.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"i just wish it were easier to get fish bucks .....
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"simply because all the cool stuff you can only get with fish bucks....
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"apparently there is a problem with the transactions going through or something.....
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"but other than the fish bucks problem.....
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"love it best game ever other then sometimes slow
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"i have an xmas event which i only got 3 xmas fish until the main breeding fish disappeared from my breeding tank.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"so now i cant play the event...
",info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"not only that i also played the  egyptian events and also found i couldnt claim my gifts from it...
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"i think these events need sorting out properly.
",info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"this game is ok needs better graphics, and people should be able to earn more fish bucks more easily.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"now i have to get more bucks to revive them!
",info
lentwentynine,ratingthree,"it is a nice game for my 3 year old but it is very addictive and requires the purchase of fish bucks to really get any where in the game.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"just wish it was easier to get fish bucks n some fish weren't so expensive
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"great except the stupid fish bucks feature, that makes you either buy them or download apps.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"fun game glitches out lots and takes your fish bucks with out buying anything
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"i'd play more if it was a little cheaper.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"also that bubble needs to go, it interferes and gets in the way..
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfive,"would be great if the makers of this game could come up with mini games to play in the game to get free fish bucks.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"should have easier ways to earn fish bucks
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"fun game fish are to expensive tho
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"good game some parts run aa lil slow..
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingthree,"best one out yet n love how i can set as wallpaper only if it would quit force close all the time would b 5 *
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"with this game  but howcome i sale the with bucks only coins you need to upgrade it
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"only thing that i don't like is that getting fish bucks is so hard.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"the only thing i feel could use some improvement, are the few and far between chances you get to earn or win tapfish dollars.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"me personally,i would make it just a bit easier and not so random ,to win dollars.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"fun game glitches out lots and takes your fish bucks with out buying anything
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"why in the event that their is they dont give me what i collect i have to keep doing it all over in my cellphone
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"it's good but wish it was easier to get fish bucks
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfive,"i love this game i have been playing it for years, unfortunately i had to get a new phone so i lost everything i had before, but its still a great stress relief game
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"i just wish the breading was a little faster and you didn't have to spend 12 fish bucks to speed up a breed!
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"just wish earning fish bucks wasn't so hard.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"just wish the thing on the bottom left corner would load.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"ever since i updated the game it wont load.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"just wish you could earn more fish bucks easier
",info
lenfortynine,ratingfive,"i've just completed the breeding event that gives the firework background on the new years event, but when i go to get it from the item store it doesn't say 0 coins like all the other event backgrounds, it's asking me for 70 odd fish bucks for it...
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"it works some times but at times it very slow
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"wish you could convert coins to fish bucks.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"i cant play the special events, so whats the point of playing at all.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"game for closes tanks size much bigger can't fetch data and lags!!!!
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"most of my fish have disapered since i have updated it
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"most recent update has caused me to not be able to breed any of my fish.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"i also lost the entire tank of the christmas fish that took me a week to breed!
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"really liked this game, have for ages but i updated it and now i have lost 3/4 of my fish. :(
",info
lensix,ratingone,"i lost almost all my fish ?????????
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"as soon as the latest update was finished loading,half my fish were gone!
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"fun glitchy and game rips off your fishbucks from time to time also support doesn't refund them everytime they should but still fun
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"wish it was easier to get more fish bucks or use coins to get the bettr fish.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"i love tapfish but the bubble is anoying.
",info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"my only problem is that when i don't have internet for a few days all my fish die.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"it would be awesome if you could save to an sd card
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingone,"this last update does not allow me to clean the tanks so all my tanks are at 65% happy. i gave made no changes to my tanks but the update caused this.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"should lower fish prices or give more free fish bucks...
",info
lenfortythree,ratingtwo,"tried to buy frog egg in the event for coins and it chraged me fish bucks instead several times and can only restore twice isn't fair i worked hard for those fish bucks please fix 3 stars deducted will go to 5 when fixed
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"when i double tap on fish in event it wont she me how far my fish is from being complete
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"i have my tanks for two day and i like it so far, i'm waiting for more ways to make money...
",info
leneight,ratingone,"no doubt all my fish are dead too!!
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"its very irritating not to have enough fish bucks, you should allow us to earn it..
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"fun game but if your phone dies you have to start from scratch.
",info

",info
lenfiftyseven,ratingfive,"works great on my tablet, my only issues with this game is the difficulty to earn coins and fish bucks. if those were easier i would play more often and i would actually buy them because i know i would be able to earn more after i blow through them so quickly because of the steep prices.
",info
lenthirtyseven,ratingfive,"i also read that there are some quests u must pay cash for and you can not skip it. we should be able to skip those even if we had to spend some coinage to do so.

lentwentythree,ratingfour,"its cool but it gets too repetitive there needs to be something more in between the growing, selling and breeding of the fishes.

lenseventeen,ratingthree,"the only thing its missing is more fish,room and fish bucks its great but sometimes boring!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"fun but not enough to do everything takes so long. breeding, growing and so on

lenthirteen,ratingthree,"mostly evrythin in the store is able to be bought by fish bucks.
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"and now i cant even play the new egyptian dive thing, it jus takes me back to my home screen.

",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"tapfish is a nice game but when it come to the bucks i a problem since i have no i have to wait 3 day.

lenthirteen,ratingfour,"also if you pay for bucks you only get coins when you sell.

leneight,ratingfour,"if you could earn bucks that would help.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"and if they got their time straight that would help too...
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfive,"just wish there was a way to trade in coins for fish bucks. don't like having to buy them in order to get the fish i need for trophies or challenges in breeding.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"should be able to earn fishbucks easier or at least make some of the fish cheaper other than that seems like a pretty long term game not bad

lenfive,ratingthree,"but it force closes alot!

lentwentyone,ratingfive,"i only wish that wen i accidently deleted the app wen i got it bac i didnt hav to start over
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"just they need more free fish bucks, instead of objects not needed.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"i wish it wasn't so dependent on spending real money.

leneleven,ratingone,"third dam time this app has takin money off my account .

",info
lentwentynine,ratingfour,"would give it 5 stars, but on my xperia mini pro the home button when visiting neighbours is really small, and i end up clicking objects rather than the button.

lenthirty,ratingfive,"the game is absolutely enthralling, only it would be nice if the in-game clock didn't run absolutely off of real time due to thr fish breeding and ageing.

leneight,ratingfive,"even 1,000,000 coins objective is stuck and not progressing
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"but i don't like that it keeps stopping
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"runs great on my s3 but sometime turns are un responsive
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"love this game but when the boost runs out on the zip line i still run really fast with no protection.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingtwo,"but today i started the app and the game was reset and i lost all my progress;i was on level 8 ,had a high score of 5,000,000+,multiplier 51 and i have lost it all.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingone,"i was so excited to download this game since the original was so good i thought this one would be better but it wont even open
",info
lennine,ratingone,"midas touch and the other latest objectives are ridiculous.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"just admit we beat the game or create new content instead of setting some inhuman goals.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"freezes on my phone everytime i try to play it.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingtwo,"great graphics and all but somehow the number of coins i connect keep getting reset to 1500 or less asseta point so i cannot buy or upgrade my characters.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"its really fun but kills my battery.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfive,"but one thing i would really like to have in the next update are extra characters and pick up power ups stack on each other. :)
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"keeps with the style of the original with a new setting (china?).
",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"although i do seem to have encountered an error trying to level up from lvl 8 (which is too hard btw!) it says to run a million points without power-ups.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfive,"i've done this several times now but the achievement stays locked, while it did work for a friend who has the exact same phone as me..
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"sometimes it comes on and works great but other wise it wont start
",info
leneight,ratingone,"the game just freezes to a black screen.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"only thing that sucks is that you have to go back to the beginning as opposed to starting where you left off.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingthree,"it was fine until it updated a few days ago after that it erased all my saved game and had to completely restart and it freezes up on me
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"a little of hang time in some transition.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"game is very fun and addictive but is extremely laggy on my samsung stratosphere.
",info
lentwenty,ratingtwo,"takes a minute plus to load and in-game lag causes me to lose before i can get very far.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"better than the first buy it sometimes gets confusing with this level design.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"on the last two obstacles and the total number of collected is frozen
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"it always exits ive had it for a while and every time it exits before i can even play so im warning
",info
lensixtyfour,ratingthree,"i played temple run 2 on one of my friends ipad and i loved it and when i download it it wont let me play it just goes to tue little s looking thing then it vibrayes my phone and then takes me back to my home screen i have uninstalled it amd redone it and everything it wont work and i really wanna play :(
",info
lenfortytwo,ratingthree,"iv played this on other devices but i dont understand why it doesnt work on my phone it stays on the loading screen and after awhile it takes me out of the app please help and yes its compatible on my phone
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"never get bored, love it wish you could create your own characters.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"keep crushing on htc desire :(
",info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"i downloaded the game and have never been able to get it to successfuly upload.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"cant get it downloded in my htc
",info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"i'll give it 5 stars if it would work for my lg thrill i never get past the picture before the start menu.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingtwo,"this game was pretty fun at the beginning but after 15 minutes of playing it got really boring plus way to many ads.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"i have obviously read in some rates and whenever i first open the app, it force closes.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"i just bought 50,000 coins this weekend and they aren't on my game wtf come on man fix this
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"only suggestion: make it so that if you get a second power up while you are already using one,  it is not ignored.
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"game hangs if i press physical back button when re-incarnate with a gem option comes.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingtwo,"one of the objectives of lifetime 500,000 coins is stuck even though i have more than 600k. this happened after the same objective came twice.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"it's fun but it always exits for no reason.
",info
lenthirtynine,ratingthree,"the double tap to use the power up when the bar gets full only works 1 out of 5 times  on the nexus 10 but on the siii the double tap to engage power up works perfectly fine, i don't understand.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"im a level 8 n the app wont open please fix with the next update i love this game but can't  it
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"the lag associated with the initial start of the game is annoying, but otherwise a great game all around.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"the only downside is that it is very repetitive  and the powerups are very dull,so at times the game os not fun.
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"objectives not being updated accordingly
",info
lensixtyone,ratingtwo,"i love the graphics on this game but for some reason it doesn't keep count of how many coins i get/have it always says a lower number than what i started the run with dk if anybody else has this problem actually thinking bout deleting it becuz its irreating me too much not being able to get my upgrades
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"it's annoying when it is down to the luck of level generation whether or not i get a good score.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"the game is great but its always lagging on my droid 3.......
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"now the problem is i can play the game once after that everytime i try to open the game it backs out 2 my home page.....
",info
lentwentysix,ratingthree,"in order for me to get to level 9 i had to beat an objective but i beat it and it wouldn't say i beat it
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"the game will not let me play it on my galaxy s why it do that please fix it
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"yea wellllll it's kinda slow.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"my only issue is that the 500,000 and 1,000,000 coin achievements are still bugged so i can't reach lvl 9!
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"the game is good but my coins keep getting deleted!!!!!!!!
",info
lennine,ratingone,"the app keeps crashing on my phone, need help.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"a change in the scenery would be nice as running over the same old ground becomes rather boring after awhile.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"the app does not let me load the menu please fix this.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"keeps getting stuck on the imangi studios screen and then returns to my home screen!
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"the only things i would want are the power-ups to be able to stack and extend.
",info
lenthirtyeight,ratingfour,"example, picking up a coin magnet, and then picking up another one while the first one is going should extend the length if the power-up, but it does not, at least not the last 5 times i noticed.
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingfour,"also, i kinda wish that the list of objectives was available, i've had to hit some of the million mark objectives 2 or 3 times because it wasn't active on the list of three objectives.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"i did not get credit for collecting 500000 coins!
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"the progress bar froze!
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"i hate the fact you can only see 3 objectives at a time.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"in addition, i have a glitch that isn't giving me the 500,000 life time coins achievement.
",info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"lastly, i'm experiencing glitches where i'll jump and i then appear way off the map and die
",info
lentwentyone,ratingone,"i paid two times 99 cents each for 5 pack of gemstone n was charged but never got the gems in the game.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"i kind of don't like temple run  2 because it makes you do only three objectives so this is my opion
",info
lennine,ratingone,"takes soooo long to load didn't like it
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"5 stars when there are more characters.
",info
lenthree,ratingfour,"more pick ups?
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"the only reason i gaveit 4 stars is because sometime when i am at a high score and going fast it will sometimes lag alittle.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"but it has too many details so that you can't focuse on the game.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"over 500k coins lifetime, but did not get credit for completing objective.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"itdoesnt deserve 5 stars because it lags and sometimes it wont even let you interact with the game.
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"i was really enjoying this game until it updated and i lost everything. all my upgrades and coins and gems.
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"the whole game keeps crasshing it it keeps going upside down.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"i had to re download it twice because it kept going upside down.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"the app won't launch keeps force closing
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"i have been loving this game but with the newest update it won't even open.
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"just starts up then force closes itself.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"seems to lag a lot and causes me to die.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"temple run 2 makes it hard to gt power-ups and that's not good
",info
lenten,ratingone,"this game won't even work after downloading just crashes!!

",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"i got a dimadond and i tried to use it but it said that i did not get one when trully did
",info

lentwelve,ratingfour,"sometimes to the point where i crash or die because of it.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"love it but it have lagss somtetimes
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"the only thing i would request would be like to see wehich level ur on and which levels are left.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"i like it, but there is some lag that really annoys me and the startup is a bit long.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingthree,"wtf man all my cions are gone it was many today but the next they its only 978 cions please fix in a new update and more characters please like the first temple run
",info
lentwentysix,ratingone,"it worked great til today, now it won't even load, this game just needs to be fixed to where it won't cut off randomly
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"whenever my player jumps on to the next platform he falls through the ground alot of the times.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"i've heard it's a great game but i cant download it.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingtwo,"you should make temple run 2 patcher free again because i am not about to pay for something that was free before
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"everytime i click on it, it just redirect me to my home screen.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"i get first logo screen then it exits
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"cant stand phone lag running me into a tree, but otherwise fun.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"needs fixing crashes on cart when in mine just loops then crashes ob galaxy s3
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"same tilting issues as everyone else.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"very cool glitch in the mine and then within a day, the whole game reset.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"downloaded update to see if that would get my stuf back, but no.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"will write a longer review on my blog about the glitch in the mine but have to give it 3 stars for resetting.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"as soon as i get past the tutorial it freezes.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"its fine for awhile but then it starts freezing up in the game and causes me to die.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfour,"i dont really like how you have to move your device over to one side almost all of the way to tilt other than that its cool
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingone,"so, i downloaded this, all excited, so i open it up and it goes to the little imagi studios picture, then it goes back to my home screen and that's it....help??
",info
leneight,ratingone,"i want it to be available on android 2.3.6!
",info
lenten,ratingone,"please update it and be abailable to lower android versions!
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"for the mission earn 500000 lifetime coins,  i got over that but the mission wouldn't complete itself!  :(
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"the objective that needs 1000000 lifetime coins is stuck.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"even after completing 500,000 lifetime coins, it's not completing my objective of completing it.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"though downloading is slow bcz of big size application.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingfour,"1 which i'm sure a lot of people have but never noticed is that when you are on a one-wheeled turn in the tunnel, collected coins do not raise the power bar.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"2 i am in the last 2 challenges and the 1,000,000 lifetime coins meter will not fill up.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"i have a little over 500,000 and the bar reads at about 200,000.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"and 3 the collected power ups should overlap like in the first version.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"good game, lags some when i first start playing. :)
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"tilt sense needs to be improved
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"i look forward to play it but everytime i try to open it, it closes please fix that thank you
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"nice graphics lalala but s*itty game play and constantly ramming into walls when switch left and right.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"cannot play more than once then have to close from glitches
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"nice game  over all only 4 stars, coins are lost if you don't use them
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"the glitches are at a turn, it lags and even if i swipe, i fall.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfour,"the second glitch is if i use the power up, then get the same ability, the ability ends at the same time as the power up.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingone,"the imangi studios screen launches but the game won't open - kicks me out to whatever screen i was on before.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"love this game, but need to accumulate coins and gems!!!!
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"it wont let me exit or even shut my phone off because it froze so bad.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"also, i lost all of my progress in the game just by exiting the app.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"it let's me download but it only loads them quits
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"i purchased 150 gems online and i also got charged for it but i didnt get any gems even after two emails sent to these guys.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"this is a very good game but i wish you could get gems easier
",info
lenten,ratingone,"keeps on force closing fix it please.samsung galaxy s 4g
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"very difficult to play & collect coins .
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfive,"it does kind of make your phone hot aftr a while and that messes up tilting because i had zero tilt response when it was heating up.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"sometimes it doesnt open and i have to delete it and redownload it to play
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"each time i try to jump or slide it freezes
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"i not able to complete 500,000 coin objective even though i have collected o er 550,000 coins.
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingthree,"i started out with 4352 coins and then played the game for a while and should have had 1048 coins more and it took my coins away now i only have 500 coins left!
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"i hv completed 100,00,000 coins objective but it still displays incomplete.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"works flawless on htc desire s but should have been a little more challenging.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"bit when i download it , it showdthe brick wall for about 45 secs and goes bck to my homepage!
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"im already completed with the ""gold miner"" (500,000 lifetime coins) objective but it stays in my current objective. :(
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingone,"my galaxy s2 hanging problem and incase application hang up time go task manager clear the temple run 2 game old score and all power ups its gone then open game new game running
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"it's giving error downloading .
",info
lenfifteen,ratingtwo,"also, when you get to level 8, eventually two of your goals become 5 and 10 million coins.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"lagging and freezing too much please fixed.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"great game but sensitivity could have been better
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"fun and addicting but keeps freezing.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"or my guy won't jump,duck please fix!
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"i keep uninstalling and installing but it won't go past the imangi studios start screen.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingthree,"and when you die after you reach a certain point that is were you should start to make the game abit easier to play.
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"battery drains too fast.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"the only problem is it some times freezes when playing
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"fun game, would get 5 if the game randomly lagging didn't result in me constantly losing
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"the game won't start
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingone,"it will not let me attain powerups if i trip monkey will not follow up still havent comepleted tutorial because after each an ever game it freezes as soon as i die.
",info
lenthirty,ratingthree,"i love this game it is the best ever but every time i play it and i press ""save me"" i have no more gems and the game shuts down.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"gathering coins dor upgrades is a little tedious.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"the objectives progress bar for collecting 500,000 coins & running 10,000,000 distance don't increase even though my stats show that i have collected 700,000 lifetime coins!
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"if it stopped lagging a lot id give it 5
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingtwo,"the graphics r good but it takes a lot of the battery and it lost all the coins that i earned after it froze
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"i loved this game but every time i try and open it up it wont open.
",info
lenfifty,ratingthree,"this game makes me feel like the developers looked at the first game, saw all of the ""juddering"" complaints and just decided to ignore them - this game is better than #1 but suffers from the same juddering and lack of response during the slow down, ir's good but not great
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"this wont run on my samsung infuse
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"i use a samsung galaxy tab and every time i try to install this app it says 'error(498)' fix this?
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"the update was so amazing, it deleted all my temple run 2 data.
",info
lenthirtyseven,ratingfour,"i had trouble swiping and tilting, it was too low for both also when in the mine shaft, when you make a turn, you have to be very fast to tilt the mine cart the other way.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"just wish you could skip objectives.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingone,"so my girlfriend wanted to play as the last chick so we bought the biggest coin pack over a day ago and never got any coins, uninstalling, any game that rips you off.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"would be better if the tilt was more responsive and the powerups renewed though.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingone,"i had the game and enjoyed it for about a week and then lost my save and have to restart to 0/10 is my rating
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"please develop more stages, tasks, and scenery.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"the levels are the same and that's super boring!
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"though i have completed the objective of five lakh life time coins but it is not showing in   the completed objective
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"after level 8, you have to score 5 million coins to reach to next level which is boring
",info
lentwentyone,ratingtwo,"everytime i get up to 2000 coins all my coins reset and it makes me unable to buy new upgrades and people!
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"i have a samsung infuse and the game only shows the imangi studios screen before exiting game.
",info
lenfortyone,ratingone,"i went on today and it worked fine but i go on 10 minutes later and it starts me over from yhe tutorial and it cleared all my game history and i just got 3 million as my highscore yesterday, this game sucks!
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingone,"it wont let me open the app it worked till today please help it worked for a while now it stoped workin screw it
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"the objective doesn't complete, if it is not shown currently on the level screen.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingthree,"like for eg: if i've run 2,500m already, before it is shown as an objective in some level screen. it is still shown as incomplete objective.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"needs better graphics and sensitivity like temple run1. :-)
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"need to fix when you're on a  zipline and your speed boost ends you keep running fast forever
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingfour,"will change to five if they fix bug as i have spent ages doing the objective to get 500,000 coins and now i have 500,100 coins and the bar is not even at half!
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"all the upgrades i bought, all the coins and gems i collected were reset.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"and when i go into settings, and pressed back, it doesnt go back.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"when i play the game sometimes there are lagging times and ends up making me see different screens shots at once.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"needs lag fuxing update bad!
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"it was working perfectly and i had so many things then randomly it reset me back to having nothing.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"this app is really fun but its slow alot.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingthree,"it's very disappointing that i lost 5500+ coins bec i unlocked all runners and left with 5500+, when i got back to the game, the balance coins shows 0.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"also the coin counts used to reset to 0 when it reaches 2000 coins.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"its a good game but thr should b few level .
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"5 stars when you add tilt sensitivity, otherwise one of the most addicting games out there
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"random visual skips(pop ins) hurt game play sometimes.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"whenever i try to open it it would go to the play store
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"everytime i click temple run it goes to my home screen
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"just a little much sometimes, good graphics, feels like the swiping & tilting is a little behind sometimes.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingfive,"so addictive but i have a kyocera hydro and i had to delete and reinstall because it would freeze now i have boo problems with it and i can not stay off it
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"it start off slow for as the movement.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"keeps losing most of my coins - so cannot upgrade.
",info
lenforty,ratingfour,"this game is fun and addicting as hell but most of the time (and especially after i reach a few million points) it starts lagging like crazy and i end up dying because the game doesn't detect my swipe.
",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"i'm not sure if it was meant to be this way, but the power meter doesn't fill up any faster when my coin value is doubled or tripled.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"it doesn't make any sense to me why the power meter would count the actual coin number, rather than the coin values.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"still crashing please help i haven't played it once on my samsung galaxy tablet  please!
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"it say always download is unsuccessful, try again
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"just a little laggy at times!
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"it's good but way to slow for me on htc could you make it faster at all?
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"used to work flawlessly before but now it crashes randomly.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"please fix, doesn't get past opening screen on lg optimus black.
",info
lenfiftythree,ratingfour,"liked the first temple run but this ones even better only thing is tht win ya got two things ya gota do back too back like swinging on the rope then ya drop off an have to jump the stream there isn't enough space to do those two things back to back.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"it gets pause for no reason on my fone (htc sensation xl). the touch graphics hv some sorta bug which is causing this.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"needs more power ups and abilities
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"although they should update to add new power ups and items.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"i play it all the time, but sometimes it doesn't jump when i swipe.
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"this game has not been working right my coins are always getting lost i hope you could fix this
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"i click the app and it goes to the homescreen.then it closes.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"only problem is that it take forever to load! :\
",info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"was great but turned on before and all my stats erased not a happy bunny!
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"but hate when it doesn't respond to my swiping actions.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"it still doesn't work for the lg thrill!
",info
lentwentysix,ratingone,"i try to open it up but i always get to the first screen then it just quits and goes back to my phones home screen!
",info
lenthirtynine,ratingfour,"it laggs in places and is annoying at times but overall this game is amazing! <3 also i think there should be a release of temple run for windows phone 7 because i would love to play this on my mobile
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"when i play the game crash on me, although other than that, the graphics are great, and it is an awesome game.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"major bugs with achievements getting stuck. like lifetime 500,000 coins at ~60% when i have 600,000
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"can you guys make an update that involves more characters to work towards
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"this application opens but after two minutes on the imangi studios screen it automatically shuts down.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"it wont open when i download it i dont know why
",info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"then i appreciate the upgrades but the sensitivity is really bad and you guys didn't add the option to change it like tr1 .
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"also there are times when swiping makes the character jump off the cliff or slide when i swipe to turn.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"it won't even open on my phone so i'm like what the heck what a waste.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"the objective ""collect 500,000 lifetime coins"" doesn't work, i have the coins but no complete objective!
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"there use to a bug where it crashes when you try to use a save me.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"great game, but only thing i hate is i always lose my coins, and never get 2 buy anything.
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"often freezes and causes my demise.
",info

lenfive,ratingtwo,"loads of bugs and glicthes.
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfour,i'm not really fond of the fact that the road is winding and i feel like i'm tilting.,non-info

",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"does not fit totally on my ge l3 e400 the screen resolution is to big.
",info

",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"nice game gr8 but it's kinda lag and slow sensitivity please fix it thnk u.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"my favorite but please add sensitivity option-thanks
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"i have redownloaded this 3 different times using three different internet connections.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"1 when i try to send out the tweet it shuts my phone down and drains all the battery.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"instead, you can add something grassy, or watery, or muddy, or maybe metallic!
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"have to tilt my phone way too much, stutters after 5k meters and crashes often.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"it's fun but it lags, its harder and the tilting is really hard.
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"does not start up on my thunderbolt.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"one problem - we have to tilt mobile too much to make the character go in the side.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingtwo,"when i went to play this game it came up big on my screen and i couldn't play it because i couldn't see the road ahead.
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"original was better, dont like new graphics, still same concept but trying too hard i think
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"the only problem is you need to tilt to extreme right/left to avoid falling.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"the game would be near perfect if there were an option to change the sensitivity as it's a bit insensitive to my phone.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"have some lag issues on p970 at the lowest graphics which effects the game dramatically.
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"i need lower graphics.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"good game but it crashes alot for me.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"hoping for updates for a new characters to spend the coins with and gems.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"it is so good but u missed some things that could make it even better like letting fb friends see score
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"when i try to open it, the game closes and it wont even open to the options!
",info
lennine,ratingone,"good game, but it freezes and crashes my phone.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"can not open game for the second time.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"graphics are decent but dont seem to respond very well.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingone,"this is unbelivable just like the first one only on android it freezes it lags how about acually puting some work into making this game, for android at least
",info
lenthree,ratingtwo,"lags a lot.
",info
leneighteen,ratingtwo,"the game itself is really good, but it freezes too much and it won't let me play.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"the screen of the game is too big and i can't see where i'm running.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"this is a asum game but  it needs  more exciymet
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"but, i somehow cannot download it to my samsung galaxy tab.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"this is a great game but sometimes it takes away your coins
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"luv it but needs more places to go looks like its goin in circle
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingfour,"i understand it's difficult to optimize the game for all android phones as there are several, several phones, but it would be nice if the lag could be fixed on the samsung galaxy s iii.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"seems slightly buggy, can we get a sensitivity or accelerometer calibrator?
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingone,"temple run 2 doesn't open for my phone it stays on the first part and exits out of the game i have the samsung infuse please fix
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"good, but sometimes it takes forever to load so when i turn and such, i die, because it doesn't do it right then.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"rubbish not open in xperia x10i
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"this app shuts down and the run is not saved but the game is still fun.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"i hate the fact that it's so hard to get coins!
",info
lennine,ratingone,"wtf it show pakege file invalid plz fix ths.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"it's slow n does not slide, jump in one go!
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"wtf the game takes ages for the points to go up the ziplines are terrible :d
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"love the game, android  v2.2.2, shows imangi and then closes, no warning, no force close, just closes, please fix imangi!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"i can turn it down but it's still audible even at zero.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"its simply cool but coins are not getting more as compared ti older one
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"nearly at the point of not been able to see my phone when tilting it left and right sgs2
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"can't tilt left to right, game is a bit too much
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"it sits on the loading screen the whole time or just exits out of the game.
",info
lenthree,ratingone,"game wont start.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"it crashes whenever i start the game  please fix i have a sidekick 4g
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"in this game the tracks are cool but the animations aren't good.
",info
lenthree,ratingthree,"sensitivity needs improvement
",info
lenten,ratingone,"also freezes occasionally when i try to exit the game.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"it stays at imangi studios for about 20+ seconds before getting to the game.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"so everyone don't waste your time trying to download  this idiotic game, because it won't download.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"the screen of the game is too big and i can't see where i'm running.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"love the game but recently it started to freeze and close when you try to use a gem for save me.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"this is my favourate game on android but it was running smoothly before but after unlocking characters and upgrades it started lagging.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"good but it should have adjustable sensitivity in the settings.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"would've given a 5 star if the option to adjust sensitivity and the magnet powerup will not overlap with the magnet pickup.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"very fun, but every time i use a save me in a mineshaft it crashes and i lose all progress from that run.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"the game freezes and force closes quite a bit.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"this is a very addicting game, but there are a few issues concerning powerups and placement.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"installed but not fit on qvga screen whyy
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"hate that the magnet doesn't multiply coins but its still good.
",info
lenfour,ratingthree,"the turning is slow.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"it takes full second or more to turn.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"i've also twice experienced a bug with the boost where it flung me off the edge.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"very fun but its too laggy on my neo v ics
",info
lenfortyeight,ratingfour,"it has everything i was so surprised by it this game cant get any better it has tons of things and you just cant stop playing it but when i click on th save me button at the end of each run the game just exsits fix it.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"am usin galaxy tab but i cant download cos it alwys error
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"the menu layout sucks , the graphics are kinda stale but the game is way better than the first!
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"only criticisn is it lags a few times.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"new cart level and zip line seem to glitch the boost power up leading to instant death.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"head start that uses 2500 coins activates automatically.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"freezing a lot on galaxy s3!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"this game is fun but idk it wont let me download it mad
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"a fun game but crashes way too much!
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"why cant i get this downloaded, :(
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfour,"i think this is a,really good and well made game, but when ever i used a shield over a river (not the one with the broken bridge) it glitches up :(
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"i've just downloaded this app twice and it doesn't work on my samsung galaxy tab gt p1010.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"it's a good game, but not as smooth as temple run 1.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"superb game but need to force close frequently that's why 3star otherwise 5star
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"lags a tiny bit sometimes but i'm sure optimization will fix that.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"and its a little confusing on what to upgrade and stuff.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingone,"there was no explanation of how powerups work, why is it that when i spend 20 gems to max out the magnet powerup, after one game goes down by  half?
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"this is game is way addicting and super fun but i hate when i try to use my gems sometimes that it crashes and doesnt save my progress.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"i was at 10500 when it crashed last no joke.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"does not fit my screen right at all!
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"i purchased a set of gold and it still hasn't shown up in my game, several days later.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"great game,  just one thing,  when i just miss falling off of those half paths,  my guy keeps running while on his side,  even jumping while lying down.
",info
lenfortysix,ratingone,"i am using an htc explorer and also have temple rum 1 but some games like raging thunder and tempal run 2 don't work whenever i turn them on it says program not responding please help even when i download apps from 4shared it says download failed help
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfive,"i love it alot butt its kind of hard it works great for my phone but takes alot of space but i really do like it.
",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"i didn't  find  exit button  on  tab2  then  i   have  to  open task manager  and  close   but  i  like   this game   i request  to  play store  to    make  exit   button
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"i hate the little ride on the tracks but it makes the game harder.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"i don't know how the game was because the ""package file was invalid""
",info
lentwentynine,ratingthree,"anytime i upgrade the 'boost' power up, however, i go to upgrades or anywhere else and the spent gems are still gone and the power up remains not upgraded.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"its fine and smooth, maybe more characters?
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"graphics stuck most of the time and i lose the game.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"till now thiz iz the most addicted game but i suggest if there is slope down.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"can you give us an option to change the tilt sensitivity please.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"it looks so oversized ' can't even play the game .
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"stays at imangi studios and force closes.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"please add sensivity option or fix it otherwise it better than first temple run
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"i love this game but after update it still won't load past the first screen on my lg optimus 3d p920 please fix:)
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"only problem is the poor performance.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"oh ya  the app freeze when i open the privacy button.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"doesn't load, closes out on its own.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"sensitivity is a little off sometimes on my note 2, hopefully this upgrade will fix it.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"while i think this is a great short term time killer, it freezes my phone quite a bit.
",info
lenfortytwo,ratingone,"ok on my tmobile sidekick for droid i can play the 1st temple run but this one it freezes when it is loading i haven't been able to play part 2 and i want too real bad please try to figure it out
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"it constantly lags which makes it impossible to take the corner and jumps.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"i think this is way harder but better graphics and on my phone takes too long to load
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"sometimes it doesn't detect gestures properly.
",info
lenfour,ratingone,"lag constantly kills me.
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"just keeps force closing plz fix
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"whole screen is filled with icons only please fix it.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"and sometimes i fly off the track after a weird combo of sliding and jumping.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"amazing but after this update it doesn't open, fix please.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"on the galaxy s 4g the game wount start up.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"it says error download ekek aww
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"good graphics but lags game resolution.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"this would be a five if it didn't crash my tablet so much
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingthree,"however, so far i have experienced severe lagging (the screen even refreshes sometime while running and i'm popped onto a completely different track).
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"besides the face that when i try to open it often it doesnt open and glitches
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"won't load game now.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingone,"i hag a motorola blur and all i get to is the start up screen even with the new patch it doesn't work
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"great game but sensitivity could have been better
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"great but can't download
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"some time the game hangs.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"i bought 50,000 coins and the coin doubler and neither work.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"i'm having trouble with the response to my touch on my phone.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"the game will load and then exits automatically.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"for exaple ill jump and it makes me slide.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"changing from 2 to 1 star because of how stupid level 8 missions are.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"i would put five stars if montana smith is brought back
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"why not 7500, 10000, 15000, 25000 coins in 1 run?
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingone,"still force closes when i open it i have a samsung infuse the old temple run works but even with the update it still doesn't work i really want to play this so please fix
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingtwo,"i could have given it 5 stars but the guy does not move left n rite fix it i will give u 5 stars i have even uninstalled it twice n installed it again
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"my only problem in playing is i always lag.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"my coin doubler does not work why is that?
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"i really enjoy the game and its a huge improvement but the lag messes with the game play to much.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"it ran perfect at first but then it started lagging bad throughout the game and i always die because of it!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"i've finished the 1m meters objective, but it's still there for me to finish.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"maybe it's a result of my finishing one of the objectives when it was shown twice.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingthree,"i have put on the new update, i have completed more than 1 million meters but my 1 million metres objective is struck and doesnt move.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingthree,"if you're trying to jump a gap, and you hit the edge, it sometimes does a weird thing where you fly to the right or left.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"i can be playing but then run off the cliff because the game lagged and i didn't see it coming.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"but takes too long when i click on the app to play but besides dat, wonderful
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"have trouble sliding sometimes.
",info
lenthree,ratingfive,"needs tilt option
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"just find the ads irritating
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"i wish that when my battery is dying and the warning comes on the game would pause like in some of my other apps.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"-i cannot see my stats, making it impossible to brag to my friends.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"still skips frames even after update.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"i was sooooo bummed that this game came out for the iphone first.
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"the designers really hated colors !?!?
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"but when the girl dies does she really have to sound so.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"basically the same game as t1, almost nothing new.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"temple run 2 is a excellent game but there's same problem in playing my st15i.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"have an s3 and this game still runs like crap.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"for one is it just me or is this game a bit stiff compared to the first one.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"this one is so bright and colourful it makes the obstacles unspottable sometimes.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"really great game but kind of jerky on turns
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"everytime i open it it will show the imangi studios logo for about a minute then it will just slose the app.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"randomized levels add to the replayability.
",info
lentwo,ratingfour,"downloading error
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"i have passed 500.000 in life coins, but the objective progress on passing that limit of coins, is locked on about 50%.
",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"however it is quite annoying when it goes to -1 on the gems can't it just stay at 0 when you don't have enough gems to save you once dying.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"only hiccup is that the later challenges are almost impossible (10,000,000 lifelong coins. are you kidding me?).
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"game is great, but the crashes are annoying enough to kill the experience.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"considering i can't even download it this is stupid
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"it keeps on freezing when i have a high score
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"i like the game but i wish that when i get multiple objectives on one round,that it would check them all off.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"it wont let me download it.
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingfive,"only thing is the tilt on tablets on the phone it works perfect but the tilt on tablets is unstable but hey at least we got temple run 2 been waiting a long time for this :d
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"tilt sensitivity s very less wen compared to first version.
",info
lenfortyseven,ratingone,"i like the game its awesome but it lags a lot and slow on my phone and i have android 4.0.4 and a 1.4 processer idk why it does that but its fun other then that and they also take coins away if you don't use them sucks
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"for some reason when i launched the game today, none of my scores were saved, all power ups gone n back to level 1.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"hoping the next update makes the tilts more responsive.
",info
lenthirtynine,ratingone,"does not work everytime i try to play it it only loads the ingram sign and then crashes and i have deleted it 2 time and downloaded it 3 time still don't work and this is on the lg thrill
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"focecloses sometimes other than that it's an okay game.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"yeah its great but now it wont even openand when it does it closes but i like graphics
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"when i open this app in android, always load and then exits the app
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"the mineshaft is way too difficult.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"and one suggestion y cnt u try to introduce a boat in d falls like railway track.
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"why i can't download this games,,,?
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"i very  hard to see waht button ur pressin because there all on top of each other.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"i expect more different levels from temple run3
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"i tried everything and it wont start.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"awesome game played ever  but got slower and get hangs while playing on xperia miro
",info
leneight,ratingone,"it wont open on my lg please fix
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"i have 500000 lt points but the objective isnt cleared.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"explorer sticks to one side abd motion sensor is not working properly after update.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingone,"hey, i really enjoy the original temple run, i would like to play the new one but for some reason it will not pass the starting screen on the lg optimus 3d please fix!
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingtwo,"i love thee game really captive and well crafted but coin denominations change frequently and minor glitches have caused it to crash but overall nice game oh yeah the coins keep resetting!
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"now its just stuck there however the 1,000,000 coin achievement is still increasing.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"the game opens with the splash screen, like it's supposed to, but then it freezes, vibrates for a second and the app crashes.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"this game is okay, but every time i pass level 5 and continue, it resets the game to back to level 5 the next day.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"it tends to skip and freeze every now and then.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"every time i open it, it ends up closing right out of it .
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"the objectives given is totally insane.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"its really good and fun etc, but its too easy and some of the objectives aren't reasonable.
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"i had lots of coins and it just all disaperd dont buy if it doning that otherwise good game
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"by far the thing that needs to be fixed most urgently is power up timing.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"temple run 2 is addicting and fun but i had to force close a few times so i uninstalled and installed again :d
",info
lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"same issue with coins and the worst thing, the graphics are draggy and jerky.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"i've never gotten a chance  to play it on my phone because it force closes every time !
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"fun game, but sometimes lags
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"i have 1,000,000 life time meters, but the objective isn't updating.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"it won't even work every time i click it it sends me back to my home screen can any one help
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"its fun and addicting, just kinda slow sometimes.
",info
lenthirty,ratingone,"it shuts down automatically after the i screen please fix i really love temple run n i played 2 on my lil sisters ipod n i loved it please please fix
",info
lentwelve,ratingtwo,"but the most necessary thing is tilt sensitivity setting for the gameplay.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"wont run on my moto defy not happy
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"does anyone else experience this delay?
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"to slow to donwload
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"don't know whats happing but now when i tilt my phone to any side the character does not tilt with the phone.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"i didn't get the extra coins that i purchased.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingone,"i have samsung galaxy s and i can't even get the game to load it stops at the big i thing this needs to be fixed.
",info
lensix,ratingone,"the game freezes when open it
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingone,"while under the influence of a power up if you get a second power up of the same kind it should extend the time of the power up.
",info
lenthirty,ratingfour,"the gameplay is bit easier now (which i liked about it) but has some glitches of its own, like the player even jumped off the track on left and right.
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"but tilting is bad
",info
lensix,ratingone,"force closes at the loading page. :/
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"the game freezes when i am playing and cause my person to die even though she isnt even close to hitting anything.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"great app but it keeps freezing on my g3
",info
lentwentynine,ratingthree,"i will try to play and once on the imangi studios i hear the menu music play but then it just takes me back to my phones home screen ! -_-
",info
lenten,ratingone,"it gets stuck and won't take any screen input.
",info
lennine,ratingtwo,"fix the lag issues and you'll get 5 stars
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"it keeps you guessing and plays rather well the one flaw is you cant play laying down it makes leaning under sensitive.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"download it it starts to load then screen goes black then it exits
",info
leneight,ratingone,"all my stats, powers, everything back to zero.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"game is good now, new challenges but definitely lags a lot and hangs after a little long run.
",info
lenthree,ratingfour,"it force closes -_-
",info
lenseventeen,ratingtwo,"the 1mil lifetime coins is also more than halfway done but still, its stuck at 3rd of the way  :(
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"power meter doesnt increase inside cave.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"it crashes every time before i can even play.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"i want my coins saved!
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"tilt needs to be more than usual to take effect.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"just having problem with tilt sensitivity.
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"at least give us a sensitivity setting!
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"i hit on the game, and it shows the picture of the ""i"" and then that exits.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingthree,"i'm not sure if the forceclosing problem when i beat my high score has been fixed or not seeing as how i haven't beaten my high score since my last review.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"the first time i downloaded it it only load up and it never works.
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingthree,"i played the game but initially found that it lags even on a dule core processor which is enough for any game to work on i better like the original temple run.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"shows only spash and close unable to play
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"had it at 5 stars but the newest update seems to misread my slide commands.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"it doesn t work on my galaxy tab it gets to the loading screen and stops i have to force close it all the time! !
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"i downloaded the game and when i try to play it the game goes back to my home screen.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfour,"i pretty much have to tilt my device so far that i almost can't see the screen to keep from falling off into the abyss.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"only problem is i keep losing all my coins & don't know why.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"lil laggy at times  but hard to put down
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingfour,"a great game with good graphics., but there is a glitch with 500k coins and pls restart the timer when we pick a powerup of the same kind, before the first one gets over.
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingthree,"its a very good, but it would be even better if you could add sensitivity in the settings, also its a little laggy at some points whitch gets me pretty mad
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"the game lags n hangs alot right frm d begning f d run in ma walkman live.
